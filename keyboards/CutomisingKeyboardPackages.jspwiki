Most keyboard types (ie for most OS's) can be customised in various ways, either
the installer or the actual keyboard itself. Below follows a list of relevant
customisation options pr OS. Most of these customisations are specified as file
pointers in the {{project.yaml}} file.

!!!Android

; App icon: specify the image file in {{targets: android: icon:}} in the
  {{project.yaml}} file; default location is in {{images/}}
; Release signing: set or export {{KEY_PW}} and {{STORE_PW}} to hold the
  password to the signing keystore. Ask Sjur or BÃ¸rre for the password,
  AND KEEP IT SAFE! Define these env. variables manually in the terminal window
  when building for release, and close the terminal window afterwards. That way
  the password will only be stored temporarily in memory. XXX what about the
  history file? This sounds like a huge security hole :O

!!!iOS

; App icon: specify the image file in {{targets: android: icon:}} in the
  {{project.yaml}} file; default location is in {{images/}}
; About text: specify the text file in {{targets: ios: aboutDir:}} in the
  {{project.yaml}} file; default location is in {{ios/About.txt}}

!!!macOS

; Keyboard Icon: same as icon location above. This is the icon seen in the
  keyboard menu in the menu bar.
