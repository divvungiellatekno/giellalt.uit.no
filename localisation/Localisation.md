# Localisation

Other than localising our own pages, Divvun and Giellatekno do not do localisation – at least not yet.
But we have built up a number of the tools and resources that are useful for translating into the languages we work on. Notably, we have freely accessible [translation memories and glossaries](../tm/TranslationMemory.html) for sevaral languages. 

Developing and integrating these resources would be something to consider in the future. We plan to collect special translation memories for localisation only, as well as developing our *machine translation* language pairs further. 

It should
be noted that we are not without experience in localisation - one of the Divvun
team members is the main person behind the North Sámi translation of
[Skolelinux](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu/).


The following are a couple of pages with useful links for future localisation
projects:


* [Windows](TranslatingWindows.html)
* [Linux](Linux.html)
