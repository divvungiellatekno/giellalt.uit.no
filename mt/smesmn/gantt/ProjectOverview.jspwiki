# Grammatical analysis and generation

* sme has in principle been done already (but might need improvement)
* smn: Large parts of the generator is still missing

Tag adjustment:

Either sme and smn have the same tags (e.g. +N+Sg+Ill), or they must
be adjusted to each other.

Goal (as far as possible): Have same tags as long as the linguistic facts are the same

# Grammatical transfer

Construction-based
