# Grammatical analysis and generation


* sme has in principle been done already (but might need improvement)
* smn: Large parts of the generator is still missing


Tag adjustment:


Either sme and smn have the same tags (e.g. +N+Sg+Ill), or they must
be adjusted to each other.


Goal (as far as possible): Have same tags as long as the linguistic facts are the same




# Grammatical transfer


Construction-based
