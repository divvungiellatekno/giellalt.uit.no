We here use sme-sma as example. Replace sme with smj or smn.
For sme-nob, see below.

The compilation happens in three steps:

# Compiling the source language transducer
# Compiling the target language transducer
# Compiling  the language pair in the apertium catalogue

!!!Compiling the source and target language transducers

We here assume you have the source files for the Saami transducers checked out.
Now, compile sme and sma transducers for machine translation. 

In Giellatekno sme and sma, do (the second, "configure" line does not
need to be written more than once):

{{{
cd $GTHOME/langs/sme
./configure --with-hfst --enable-apertium
make
sudo make install

cd $GTHOME/langs/sma
./configure --with-hfst --enable-apertium
make
sudo make install
}}}

You have now created two binary files for each language, 
one analyser and one generator. They are created during compilation
and stored in the {{tools/mt/apertium}} folder. 

* tools/mt/apertium/apertium-sme-smn.smn-sme.LR.att.gz 
* tools/mt/apertium/apertium-smn.smn.RL.att.gz 




!!! sme-nob

Compile sme as shown above. nob should be compiled as follows:

{{{
cd apertium/languages/apertium-nob
./autogen.sh
make
}}}

And then:

cd ../../trunk/apertium-sme-nob
./autogen.sh --with-lang1=/Users/lan000/gtsvn/langs/sme/tools/mt/apertium
--with-lang2=/Users/lan000/apertium/languages/apertium-nob
make

!!!Troubleshooting

Here comes a couple of error messages:

''configure: error: You don't have lrx-comp installed''

So, install it:

{{{
    svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/apertium/svn/trunk/apertium-lex-tools

    cd apertium-lex-tools
    ./autogen.sh
    make
    sudo make install
}}}


''configure: error: Package requirements (lttoolbox >= 3.2.0) were not met:''
''No package 'lttoolbox' found''

So, find it. Is it where it should? Yes:

{{{
   ls /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
}}}

But do we find it? No.
Det m√• finnes lttoolbox.pc i $PKG_CONFIG_PATH

{{{
   lt-proc --version
}}}

Viss du har den korrekt lttoolbox-versjonen, da sett den folgende linjen i $HOME/.profile 

{{{
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
}}}
