## Bidix improvement

We will improve bidix by:
* frequency sorting: Ciprian
* checking sme lemmas: Lene
* checking smj lemmas:
    - in dev: sh bidix-sanity.sh > sanityoutput (Sandra)
    - if same structure in sme and smj, one can remove the word pair instead of lexicalizing it
* adding word pairs from Lenes giza-experiments in 2008: Lene makes a csv-file, Sandra proofread
* checking sme verbs IV vs TV: done
* change back to Po, Pr and Adv in smj-lexc
* add transfer word pairs from termlists (sme-nob + nob-smj) and compare them to bidix:
    - Give priority to sme-nob/nob-smj (where nob-smj = Kintel) pairs that are already in bidix, and lift they over in a priority bidix list
    - evaluate sme-smj-bidix not in sme-nob/nob-smj and sme-nob/nob-smj not in sme-smj-bidix separately, after the seeded gang
    - For the sme-smj-bidix residue: Give priority to sme-smj pairs where smj are already in FST
* make missing list from sme-corpus: Trond

## Progress

### Pronouns
There are two files with sentences with pronouns in texts/ for comparing and improving word pairs in bidix and harmonising tags in FST

### Transfer rules
We will utilize on work done with other sme-smX pairs by
* using the same names on variabels and sets
* document relevant rules in a document on [smX MT web-page](/mt/infra/TransferRules_examples.html)
* suggest for Francis to hold regular meetings for discussing transfer rules, and improvements

## Next meeting
Friday 8.1 kl 13 (Sandra and Lene)

We'll have meeting once a week (but next meeting will be the last week of January)
