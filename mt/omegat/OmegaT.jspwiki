!!!Installation

The user documentation page for OmegaT refers to installation and user documentation, and can be found here:

* [Installation instructions|http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Apertium_OmegaT_Native]
* [Documentation|http://omegat.org/documentation] (Go for the __English html__ one)

!!!Adapting to our language pairs

The idea is to offer a set of ready-made folders, in two different formats:

# as a one-time downloading of a zipped file archive
# as svn checkout (via Tortoise on Windows) for access to updates

For the time being, the folders are at [https://gtsvn.uit.no/biggies/trunk/mt/omegat/].

The idea is to put the following resources into the following subdirectories:

* into {{dictionary}}: our StarDict dictionary smenob (OmegaT [documentation|http://omegat.sourceforge.io/manual-standard/en/chapter.dictionaries.html])
* into {{glossary}}: term lists, partly fad-marked pairs, partly from satni.org, cf [documentation|http://omegat.sourceforge.io/manual-standard/en/chapter.glossaries.html]
* into {{tm}}: our parallel texts, __all files fused into one .tmx file__ (or one per theme), cf [documentation|http://omegat.sourceforge.io/manual-standard/en/chapter.translation.memories.html]
* into {{omegat}}: a file segmentation.conf, for doing sentence level segmentation, cf. [documentation|http://omegat.sourceforge.io/manual-standard/en/chapter.segmentation.html]

The source and target folders are given ''svn ignore'' status, as we develop the folders we should determine what other files to ignore and what to share.


!!!The language pairs

The language pairs are of three types:

# __smesmn, smesmj, smesmn:__ The main thing here is MT, glossaries and
  dictionaries are less interesting since they are already in bidix,
  and since we do not have a OmegaT-compatible tokenizer to look up
  inflected words.
# __nobsme, nobsmj, nobsma, finsme, finsmn, finsms:__ Here we have no MT
  (except for finsme, which is not much developed). The focus here is
  on glossaries (fad project, etc.) and translation memory
# __smasme, smjsme, smnsme, smenob:__ these we ignore in OmegaT for now.
  They are mainly made for understanding, not for text production.

!!!Working plan

# Add glossaries (__done for nobsmX__)
# Improve mt  (__done for nobsmX__)
# Develop segmentation.conf (__in progress for sme__)
# Test and evaluate 

!!!Future plans

Adding more resources:

* Improve segmentation.conf
* Investigate the settings pane for optimal choices
* Add proofing tools (hunspell)
* Lemmatisation of dictionary lookup (FST or StarDict)

!!!HFST Tokenizer

You can get the hfst tokenizer ready compiled. You need to download:

*[Hfst
  tokenizer|http://divvun.no/static_files/omegat-hfst-tok/omegat-hfst-tokenizer-0.3.jar]
*[Hfst lookup library|http://divvun.no/static_files/omegat-hfst-tok/hfst-1.1.5.jar]
*[HPPC|http://central.maven.org/maven2/com/carrotsearch/hppc/0.7.2/hppc-0.7.2.jar] (OmegaT 3.x - TODO - not found)

And put them into {{~/Library/Preferences/OmegaT/plugins}} (create the dir if it's not there)

Hfst tokenizer source is at [github|https://github.com/divvun/OmegaT-hfst-tokenizer]
