# Apps

## Backend

Serves as a restful interface to dictionaries and term collections.

An obsolete version seems to live in `$GTHOME/apps/risten2/backend`, the current version is found in `/home/exist/eXist/webapp/WEB-INF/data/fs/db/apps/satni/`.
The obsolete code is correct and added to the latter folder by eXist when uploading files.

## Frontend

Serves as the search interface to dictionaries and term collections found in the satni backend.

An obsolete version seems to live in `$GTHOME/apps/risten2/frontend/index.js`, the current version is found in `/home/exist/eXist/webapp/WEB-INF/data/fs/db/apps/satni/index.js`
The obsolete version is compiled from `assets/` files and added to the latter folder by eXist when uploading files.

To get started with frontend development run `npm install` in `frontend/`.
This will install all dependencies.

`main.js` is the main code that loads satni component. satni is divided into smaller components, dictlist, search and articles. Each of them are in the satni interface in a row. They are called by the main satni component. Additionally there are rest component, util component, and translation component. They are dependent on `mithril` js framework, which is located in `mithril.js.org`. Also Bootstrap is used, but this is included in the backend by eXist shared resources. CSS file is located in `assets/css/` folder.
