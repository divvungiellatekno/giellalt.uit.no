#  Overview


Running the [Gïelese](http://gielese.no/play/) process depends on the following
things on the *gtweb* server:


- nginx, the HTTP server, which connects to Gïelese processes
- mongodb, which stores user data, points, and such.
- Gïelese python processes, served via gunicorn


Nginx may be started whenever, and ideally will be running already.
Mongodb must be running first, so that the Python processes can
connect.


#  Starting the service


Do this as your regular user account, thus the sudo password will be your usual
sudo password.


```
    sudo service gielese-mongodb start
```


2.) Then if all is good... 


```
    sudo service gielese start
```




NB: commands accepted by these processes are also stop, and restart; however,
make sure to start mongodb first, otherwise the gielese process will not start.


#  Restarting the services


The order to restart these is such that the web service is not running without mongo, thus:


```
    sudo service gielese stop
    sudo service gielese-mongodb stop
    sudo service gielese-mongodb start
    sudo service gielese start
```
