        <title>Adding many words to the lexicon</title>
        <p>Typically, we have a long list of words, (several tens of thousands). Do a reverse sort on that list. If it is called <strong>newwords</strong>, give the command <strong>rev newwords | sort | rev > r-newwords</strong>.</p>
        <p>Take out a set of lines that behave the same way, e.g. all ending in &quot;njárga&quot;. Make a new file, <strong>C-x C-f njarga1</strong>, and another file <strong>njarga2</strong>. The file njarga1 should contain everything before the &quot;:&quot; mark, and the file njarga2 everything after the &quot;:&quot; mark. Cf. the line:</p>
        <p>Stuoranjár0ga:Stuoranjár'ga GOAHTI ;</p>
        <p>The file njarga1 should contain entries like</p>
        <p>Stuoranjár0ga</p>
        <p>and the file njarga2 should contain entries like</p>
        <p>Stuoranjár'ga GOAHTI ;</p>
        <p>So, starting out with a list containing words like &quot;Stuoranjárga&quot;, change the entries in njarga1 to &quot;Stuoranjár0ga&quot;, and the entries in njarga2 to &quot;Stuoranjar'ga GOAHTI ;&quot;. Use the command <strong>M-x queTAB-TAB</strong>.</p>
        <p>Save both files, and leave emacs.</p>
        <p>Then you should <strong>paste</strong> these two files together. To do that, on the command line write the command</p>
        <p>paste -d&quot;:&quot; njarga1 njarga2 | less</p>
        <p>
          <strong>-d</strong> tells that you want to use a separator mark, and the mark you want to use (:) must be in quotation marks. Then comes the file (the leftmost file first), and since you want to control the output, you should write <strong>| less</strong>. If everything works, you should replace the last part with a command that creates a new file (e.g. named <strong>> 2njarga</strong>), or, if you know what you are doing, you should just add it directly to the file where you want it, with the <strong>>></strong> operator.</p>
        <p>paste -d&quot;:&quot; njarga1 njarga2 > 2njarga</p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p>paste -d&quot;:&quot; njarga1 njarga2 >> propernoun-sme-lex.txt</p>
