      <h1>How to use emacs for our purposes</h1>
      <h2>Adding words, one by one</h2>
      <p>[to be written..]</p>
      <h2>Adding many words to the lexicon</h2>
      <p>Typically, we have a long list of words, (several tens of thousands). Do a reverse
         sort on that list. If it is called <strong>newwords</strong>, give the command <strong>rev newwords | sort | rev &gt; r-newwords</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>Take out a set of lines that behave the same way, e.g. all ending in "njárga". Make
         a new file, <strong>C-x C-f njarga1</strong>, and another file <strong>njarga2</strong>. The file njarga1 should contain everything before the ":" mark, and the file njarga2
         everything after the ":" mark. Cf. the line:
      </p>
      <p>Stuoranjár0ga:Stuoranjár'ga GOAHTI ;</p>
      <p>The file njarga1 should contain entries like</p>
      <p>Stuoranjár0ga</p>
      <p>and the file njarga2 should contain entries like</p>
      <p>Stuoranjár'ga GOAHTI ;</p>
      <p>So, starting out with a list containing words like "Stuoranjárga", change the entries
         in njarga1 to "Stuoranjár0ga", and the entries in njarga2 to "Stuoranjar'ga GOAHTI
         ;". Use the command <strong>M-x queTAB-TAB</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>Save both files, and leave emacs.</p>
      <p>Then you should <strong>paste</strong> these two files together. To do that, on the command line write the command
      </p>
      <p>paste -d":" njarga1 njarga2 | less</p>
      <p>
         <strong>-d</strong> tells that you want to use a separator mark, and the mark you want to use (:) must
         be in quotation marks. Then comes the file (the leftmost file first), and since you
         want to control the output, you should write <strong>| less</strong>. If everything works, you should replace the last part with a command that creates
         a new file (e.g. named <strong>&gt; 2njarga</strong>), or, if you know what you are doing, you should just add it directly to the file
         where you want it, with the <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> operator.
      </p>
      <p>paste -d":" njarga1 njarga2 &gt; 2njarga</p>
      <p>or</p>
      <p>paste -d":" njarga1 njarga2 &gt;&gt; propernoun-sme-lex.txt</p>
