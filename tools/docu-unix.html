      <h1>Crashcourse in Unix/Linux for new users</h1>
      <p>[Note that I will write all commands (that is everything you are
         supposed to write in) in <strong>boldface</strong>. After each command,
         press the <strong>enter</strong> key. I print the answers from the
         machin in "quotes". I refer to Unix, but everything I say holds for
         Linux as well. The first section is a first aid for newcomers, you will
         find lists of commands and some longer explanations further down in the
         document. And if you want to close the session and leave gtlab for
         today: print <strong>logout</strong>.]
      </p>
      <h2>Where am I, what do I do, and how do I move around?</h2>
      <p>To find out where you are, print <strong>pwd</strong>. This means
         "print working directory", and does what it says. If your username is
         trond, and you are in your home directory, it will answer
         "/home/trond". To list the files and directories (a directory is the
         same as a folder in mouse-based systems) in the working directory,
         print <strong>ls</strong>. Print <strong>ls -l</strong> to see file
         size and date as well. The command <strong>ls -lt</strong> sorts after
         date, <strong>ls -lS</strong> after size (there should be set up
         shortcut commands <strong>ll</strong>, <strong>lt</strong> and
         <strong>lS</strong> for these, ask Trond if the shortcuts do not
         work.
      </p>
      <p>In Unix, directories can be referred to by absolute or relative
         reference. No matter where I am, the command <strong>ls -l
            /home/trond/gt/</strong> will always list the content of gt. Since the
         path starts with "/", it refers to the Root directory, which always is
         the same. If I stand in my home directory, I can write <strong>ls -l
            gt</strong> (since it contains gt), but if I stand in any other
         directory (e.g. gt itself, or sme, etc.), I cannot do that, since
         these directories do not contain a directory gt. Standing in sme (a
         daughter of gt, I must write <strong>ls -l ../</strong>. So, standing
         in your home directory, the command <strong>ls ../</strong> tells you
         the name of the other users on the system.
      </p>
      <p>To move from one directory to the other we use the
         <strong>cd</strong> (change directory) command. To get from your home
         directory to the North Saami directory, print <strong>cd
            gt/sme</strong>. To get one directory up, <strong>cd ..</strong>, to
         get two up, <strong>cd ../..</strong>. Check where you are with the
         <strong>pwd</strong> command. One up and one down (from North to
         Lule Sámi) <strong>cd ../smj</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>To start a program (like emacs, lynx, lexc, twolc), print the name
         of the program. With lynx, it is convenient to start with <strong>lynx
            gt/doc/index.html</strong> (or <strong>lynx index.html</strong>, if
         you already are in the doc directory). From index.html you can find
         all the other files (such as this one).
      </p>
      <p>Use the <strong>TAB</strong> character to complete names. So, if
         the directory name (or file name) you want to type has a uniqe
         beginning, type it and press <strong>TAB</strong>. In your home
         directory, print <strong>ls g</strong> and then print
         <strong>TAB</strong>. It will complete with "t/" (if you have no other
         directories or files that start with g). Then print <strong>s</strong>
         and <strong>TAB</strong>, it gives a pling (there are more than one
         directory starting with "s". Press <strong>TAB</strong> again, and it
         lists the 7 candidates. Then, complete with <strong>me</strong> (if
         you want to go the North Sámi). The same you can do with file names
         as well.
      </p>
      <p>Unix remembers all your previous commands. Typing the up arrow
         gives you the previous command, down arrow the next. The command
         <strong>history</strong> documents what you have done until now. Here
         is a typical case: You type <strong>lookup -flags mbTT
            bin/sme.fst</strong> (because you want to check some North Sámi
         words). Nothing happens. Then you do <strong>pwd</strong>, and finds
         yourself in your own root directory, instead of in gt/sme, where you
         thought you were (you get the answer "/home/trond" instead of
         "/home/trond/gt/sme". Type <strong>cd gt/sme</strong> to get to the
         right place. Now, instead of typing the long lookup command again, hit
         the up arrow key three times (one for the cd command, one for the pwd
         one, and voila, you see the lookup command again. Press enter, and
         this time it will work.
      </p>
      <h2>Editing input by means of the command line</h2>
      <p>Writing, saving, etc. is done in emacs or other programs. But we
         use the command line as well.
      </p>
      <p>To list all lines in a file with a certain content we use the
         command <strong>grep</strong>. So, to list all lines that contain the
         string "Sg1" in the file sme-lex.txt, write <strong>grep Sg1
            sme-lex.txt</strong> (in the gt/sme directory). If you want to search
         for whitespace (mellomrom, välilyönti) as well, use the ' ': The
         command <strong>grep 'an K' src/sme-lex.txt</strong> gives all
         suffixes ending in "an" and leading to the K lexicon. Similarily,
         <strong>grep ' in leat' corp/ntunix</strong> (where "ntunix" is the
         name of the file containing the New Testament) gives all the strings "
         in leat" in that text. Note that <strong>grep 'in leat'
            corp/ntunix</strong> gives a different results (it matches many other
         strings, e.g. "geain leat" as well). Grep and other searches can be
         extended by REGULAR EXPRESSIONS. Thus, the symbol "." means "any one
         character", and the search string <strong>'lea. '</strong> thus
         matches both lean, leat and any other 4-letter word beginning with lea
         (including the word "lea" followed by two empty spaces). A list of
         regular expressions can be found below.
      </p>
      <p>To see the content of a file, use the command
         <strong>less</strong>. Thus, (in src/) to see the file punct-sme.txt,
         print <strong>less punct-sme-lex.txt</strong> (<strong>less
            pu</strong> and then <strong>TAB</strong> will be enough, by the way).
         If the file is long (e.g. noun-sme-lex.txt), less gives you one
         screenful at a time, and you can go forward by hitting the space bar
         (mellomromstasten, välilyöntinappi). You return to the command line by
         printing <strong>q</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>Often, the output from grep and other commands is all to long for
         one screenful. Here we need to do more than one thing at the time, and
         we use the "|" symbol (English: pipe, Finnish: putki, Norwegian: pipe,
         dessverre). It is a VERY IMPORTANT symbol for all of us, and it means:
         I take what I get from the left and give it to the right. Thus, since
         the command <strong>grep ' in leat' ntunix</strong> returns more than
         one screenful, we give the output of that command as input to the less
         command, by using the pipe. Write: <strong>grep ' in leat' ntunix |
            less</strong>, and you get the result one screenful at the time. The
         command may be quite complex. Thus, to see the analysis of the New
         Testament, write (in <strong>sme)</strong></p>
      <p><strong><code>cat corp/ntunix | preprocess --abbr=bin/abbr.txt |
               lookup -flags mbTT -utf8 bin/sme.fst | lookup2cg | vislcg
               --grammar=src/sme-dis.rle | less</code></strong></p>
      <p>The first command (<strong>cat ntunix</strong>) just takes the text
         and feeds it to the pipe. The second command (<strong>preprocess
            --abbr=abbr.txt</strong>) uses the program preprocess to separate
         commmas, etc., and make the file into a list of words. Thus, the
         string "No, todyay." becomes
      </p>
      <p>No<br>,<br> today<br> .
      </p>
      <p>The third command, <strong>lookup -flags mbTT sme.fst</strong> uses
         the lookup program to analyse the input, by using the North Sámi
         parser sme.fst. The output, an analysed version of the New Testament,
         is given to the less command, one screenful at a time, and the whole
         process takes less than 3 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>The output can be manipulated further. To extract all adverbs,
         replace "less" above with the string <strong>grep '+Adv' | sort | uniq
            -c | sort | less</strong> (to get them in alphabetical order) or
         <strong>grep '+Adv' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nbr | less</strong> (to
         get them sorted according to frequency).
      </p>
      <p>The magic commands are <strong>sort</strong> (sort the file, one
         line at a time, alphabetically), <strong>uniq</strong> (delete
         repeated identical lines), <strong>rev</strong> (reverse lines, e.g.
         "every day" becomes "yad yreve"). Note how combining rev and sort
         gives a reverse wordlist, sorted according to last letter.
      </p>
      <p>If you want to dismbiguate, you should write</p>
      <p><strong>cat corp/ntunix | preprocess --abbr=bin/abbr.txt | lookup
            -flags mbTT -utf8 bin/sme.fst | lookup2cg | vislcg
            --grammar=src/sme-dis.rle | less</strong></p>
      <p>The string up to <code>lookup2cg</code> is the same as above. The
         command <code>lookup2cg</code> calls for a script that changes the
         input from "Xerox style" to "CG style", i.e. to the form that the
         constraint grammar program <code>vislcg</code> demands. Then we call
         up vislcg, with the option <strong><code>--grammar</code></strong>,
         and we set the grammar file to <code>sme-dis.rle</code>, i.e. to our
         disambiguation file. If we also want to see the rule number, we add
         the flag <strong>--minimal</strong>, and the whole command becomes
      </p>
      <p><strong>cat corp/ntunix | preprocess --abbr=bin/abbr.txt | lookup
            -flags mbTT -utf8 bin/sme.fst | lookup2cg | vislcg
            --grammar=src/sme-dis.rle --minimal | less</strong></p>
      <p>The numbers S:1234 etc. are the line numbers in the sme-dis.rle
         file.
      </p>
      <h2>Editing the text on the command line itself</h2>
      <p>Printing a long command line many times (as the example above) is a
         waste of time. Instead, you should use the arrow up key, get a copy of
         the last command(s), and edit it again. Also, if you do not know
         whether your command will ork the way you plan, you may build it one
         command at a time, and check the output for each part. Now, you need
         to edit the text on the command line. If your arrowkeys are set, the
         arrow left / arrow right will work. The most efficient way of editing
         is to use the editing shortcuts that you already have learned (?!) for
         emacs. A short recapitulation / introduction: <strong>ctrl-a</strong>
         beginning of line, <strong>ctrl-e</strong> end of line, <strong>ctrl-b
            ctrl-f</strong> one step to the left/right, <strong>ctrl-d</strong>
         delete the character under the cursor, <strong>ctrl-k</strong> delete
         from cursor and to end of line. With <strong>esc</strong> instead of
         <strong>ctrl</strong> in front of <strong>f, b, d</strong> you move
         and delete words instead of characters.
      </p>
      <h2>Switching between programs and the command line</h2>
      <p>You may jump out of any program (e.g. emacs, lynx, lookup), to the
         command line, with the command <strong>ctrl-Z</strong>. Once on the
         command line, you get back again by typing <strong>fg</strong>. This
         is nice if you have forgotten the name of some file, if you just want
         to count how many words a certain file contains midway in an emacs
         session, etc.
      </p>
      <p>Remember to type fg, and not open the same program again!
         Otherwise, you will end up with several parallel versions of the same
         program running. If you suspect you did just that, then go to the
         command line (ctrl-Z), and print <strong>jobs</strong>. This should
         give you a list of how many programs you have open in the same window
         at the same time (no more than one is recommended, unless you have a
         very tidy head).
      </p>
      <h2>Getting help</h2>
      <p>Online help is available, especially via the <strong>man</strong>
         (short for "manual" command. Thus, <strong>man ls</strong> explains
         the ls command. <strong>man man</strong> explains the man command
         itself. There are two bad things with the man pages: First, in order
         to read about a command, you must know its name. You cannot write
         <strong>man list</strong> and accept Unix to understand that you want
         to list files (instead you can read about a totally different
         command). Second, the man pages are well known for being very cryptic
         (the best guarantee for understanding them is that you know what the
         command does already). Still, the man pages are useful to explore the
         properties of the commands. For the <strong>uniq</strong> and
         <strong>sort</strong> command above, we added some FLAGS, that is
         small letters with a "-" symbol in front of them (there can be more
         than one flag, in which case only the first of them gets the "-" sign,
         sort had e.g. 3 flags, and in an earlier example, ls had two. As you
         can see from the man pages, the -c flag makes uniq count how many
         identical lines there are, whereas the -nbr of sort lists it input
         addording to number (n), ignoring blank lines (b) and reversed (r),
         that is with the most common word first.
      </p>
      <p>If the man page is too cryptic, you can instead write <strong>info
            sort</strong> (or any command name). The info pages have much more
         text, stretching over several pages. The text is structured as a
         primitive web browser: <strong>TAB</strong> brings you to the next
         link, you follow the link by pressing enter, and when the top of the
         screen says Next:, Prev:, Up:Top, etc., you go there by pressing
         <strong>n</strong>, <strong>p</strong>, <strong>u</strong>, etc. You
         leave both man and info by pressing <strong>q</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>Somtimes, but not always, the <strong>apropos</strong> command may
         also help. To have a list of commands related to e.g. sorting, type
         <strong>apropos sort</strong>. Searching around for help on a Unix
         system, not knowing what to look for seldom is a good idea, thus, you
         should ask a local guru, and you should buy a reference book.
