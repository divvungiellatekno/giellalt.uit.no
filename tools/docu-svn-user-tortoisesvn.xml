          <title>The program</title>
          <p>TortoiseSVN is a graphical program for using SVN. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">tortoisesvn.net</a>. Just download the program and install it as any other Windows program. This is the program we recommend for using SVN on Windows.</p>

          <title>Installation</title>
          <p>Create the folder where you want to have your project files. Then right click on it and select <code>TortoiseSVN → Checkout…</code>. Enter the URL to checkout, in this case  <code>https://victorio.uit.no/langtech/trunk</code> and click on <code>OK</code>. The files are then downloaded to the folder.</p>
          <p>In order to be able to check in, fill in your username and password.</p>

	  <title>Usage</title>
	  <p>When the program is installed, go to the folder where you want to keep the language technology files (e.g. <code>My Documents</code>). In that folder, right-click with the mouse on an empty spot in the folder. You will note that the context-sensitive menu has some additions in the middle, where it reads SVN and something. Choose the <code>SVN Checkout</code>. You will then get a panel, where you fill in your account data.</p>
	  <p>Now you may edit the files, e.g. with <code>EditPad Lite</code> or <code>XMLEditor</code>. When you have edited them you will note that the green symbol attached to the file symbol has turned orange. This means you should <code>check in</code>. Right click on the file icon, and choose <code>check in</code>. Write a log message, and click OK.</p>
	  <p>The general principles are the same for SVN usage here as elsewhere: Always update before you start working (right-click, and SVN Update), and always check in when you are done with your work, minimum once a day.</p>
