The Forrest dtd is documented on their site:


* [Basic documentation and howto](http://forrest.apache.org/dtdx/dtd-docs.html). Note that we use 2.0.
* [A visual introduction](http://forrest.apache.org/dtdx/document-v20.html)


Note that you must write *forrest validate* before checking in. Running 
the site locally (*f8*) is not enough, since your own computer is more 
tolerant than the Forrest dtd.
