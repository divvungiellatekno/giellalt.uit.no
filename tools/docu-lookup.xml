        <title>Intro</title>
        <p>The <em>lookup</em> tool itself is described at the Xerox page (cf. links from the main page). Here is some info on lookup that is relevant to the present project.</p>

        <title>Flags</title>
        <p>Note the flags,</p>
        <p>-flag mbTT</p>
        <p>The mb flag tells that lookup accepts multicharacter input both in the upper and lower language, which is crucial, as we use digraphs a1, c1, etc. for the Saami characters. The TT flag tells that there is no separator between the lexeme and the tags to follow it, and is there only for better readability. This is not the optional flag, though, as the tabs in the output do not quite behave.</p>
