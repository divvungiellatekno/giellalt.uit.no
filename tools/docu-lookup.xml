      <h1>lookup</h1>
      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>The <em>lookup</em> tool is shortly described at the <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis639/docs/lookup.html">lookup documentation page</a> at. Here is some info on lookup that is relevant to the present project.
      </p>
      <h2>Flags</h2>
      <p>Note the flags,</p>
      <p>-flags mbTT</p>
      <p>The mb flag tells that lookup accepts multicharacter input both in the upper and lower
         language, which is crucial since we use UTF-8. The TT flag tells that there is no
         separator between the lexeme and the tags to follow it.
