# Graphical presentation of transducers


Install graphviz:


```
sudo port install graphviz
```


Compile the transducer with foma, and save it as a .dot file:


```
foma[0] load stack exemplefile.fst
foma[1] print dot > examplefile.dot
foma[1] quit
```


On the command line


```
dot -T png -O examplefile.dot
```


This command creates a .png file, which can be opened:


`open examplefile.dot.png`
