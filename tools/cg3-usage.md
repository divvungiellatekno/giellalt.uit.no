How to use the vislcg3 parser
=============================

Basic usage
-----------

This page is incomplete. Consult the [vislcg3
documentation](http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/) as well as these notes.

The command line looks like this (for sme, supposing you stand in the
sme directory):

    sme$ cat sometext.txt | preprocess --abbr=bin/abbr.txt | lookup -flags mbTT bin/sme.fst |  ../script/lookup2cg | vislcg3 -g src/sme-dis.rle | less

Flags and their use
-------------------

The vislcg3 program contains a large number of **flags**, or usage
options. A list of the flags may be obtained by writing the following
command:

    vislcg3 --help

i.e., by using the flag *--help*. The most relevant flags for our use
are the following:

-   **-g src/sme-dis.rle:**  
    This flag selects the grammar file
-   **--sections n:**  
    This flag sets the number of CONSTRAINT sections that are applied.
    In this way it is possible to study the effects of one rule set at a
    time.
-   **--trace:**  
    This flag tells the parser to include information of what constraint
    rules are invoked in each concrete case. The flag is crucial for
    studying the effects of the different rules.
