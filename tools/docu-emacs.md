An introduction to emacs
========================

Emacs is a very good editor, available on all unix systems, also when
working on a remote machine. The

Crash course
------------

To start emacs, write *emacs filename*, where *filename* is the name of
the file you want to edit. Emacs will open the file you have requested.
If you want to create a new file, then write the same command, and emacs
will open with a blank page. In order to quit, press *C-x C-c* (where
C-x means "hold down the ctrl key and press x"). Emacs will then ask you
whether you want to save the file or not. If you suddenly are unable to
type anything, and get strange messages on the screen, type *C-g*
(interrupt)

The best short emacs reference is found in the emacs chapter of OReillys
*UNIX in a Nutshell*. Other references may be found below.

A short list of the most important commands
-------------------------------------------

C = ctrl, M = meta (either ESC or Alt (Linux) or ESC (Mac). Note that on
Linux, the key following meta is pressed at the same time as the meta
key whereas on Mac, it is pressed after the ESC key have been released.

Basic commands

-   **C-g:**
    Interrupt
-   **C-s, C-x C-c:**
    save, save and exit
-   **C-w:**
    write to file
-   **C-x C-f filename:**
    open the file "filename"

Commands for searching in lexica

-   **C-s example, C-r example:**
    Search forward, search backward, after the string "example"
-   **C-u C-s ^example:**
    Search for the string "example" in the **beginning** of a line

Moving around

-   **C-a, C-e, C-n, C-p:**
    beginning of line, end of line, next line, previous line.
-   **C-v, M-v:**
    next page, previous page
-   **M-&gt;, M-&lt; :**
    beginning of document, end of document

Much of what follow is taken from a text written by [*Keith
Waclena*](http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/) .

### Notation

In the rest of this document I use the standard Emacs notation to
describe keystrokes:

-   **`C-x` :**
    For any *x*, the character Control-*x*.
-   **`M-x` :**
    For any *x*, the character Meta-*x*. Meta can be typed in two ways.
    M-v (scroll up, just to pick an example) may be typed ESC and then v
    (that is: Press ESC, take away your finger, and then press v). The
    faster way is to use the Meta key. If you use putty.exe on a Windows
    PC, the meta key could be Ctrl + Alt. Putty.exe has a Settings menu
    (TODO: have a look at putty). Anyway, M-x means "ESC, and thereafter
    x", or, equivalently, "hold down the Meta key(s) and press x".
-   **`C-M-x` :**
    For any *x*, the character Control-Meta-*x*.
-   **`RET` :**
    The return key (`C-m` actually). This is the key to the right of the
    letters, not the one in the lower right corner of the keyboard.
-   **`SPC` :**
    The space bar.
-   **`ESC` :**
    The escape key, or, equivalently, `C-[`

Emacs Command Structure
-----------------------

Every command has a long name, which you can look up in the
documentation, like `kill-line`, `delete-backward-char`, or
`self-insert-command`. These commands are *bound* to keystrokes for
convenient editing. We call such a pairing of keystroke and command a
key binding.

### Prefix or Compound Keys

Prefix commands often group together commands that are somehow related.

The standard prefix commands are:

-   **`C-c` :**
    Used for commands that are specific to particular [modes](#modes),
    so they are free to be used for different commands depending on
    context. These are the most variable of Emacs commands.
-   **`C-h` :**
    Used for Help commands.
-   **`C-x` :**
    This prefix is used mostly for commands that manipulate files,
    buffers and windows.

There's one Emacs command that can be used to execute any other command
by typing it's long name: `M-x`. When you type `M-x` Emacs prompts you
for the name of any command, and then executes it.

### The `ESC` Prefix

There's one other prefix command that's both very important and
completely redundant: the `ESC` prefix.

Not all keyboards provide a `Meta` key that sets the high order bit. On
a PC running Emacs natively, the `ALT` key is used for `Meta`. But when
using a PC to talk to a Unix box via some telecommunications program --
well, you guessed it -- the `ALT` key may not work for this.

But if you have no `Meta` key, all is not lost. You just use the `ESC`
prefix. `M-a` becomes `ESC a`; `C-M-f` becomes `ESC C-f` (remember the
equivalence of `C-M-f` and `M-C-f` and this will make sense).

There's only one trick: `ESC` is *not* a shift key. It's actually an
ASCII character, not a key modifier. This means that you don't try to
hold down `ESC` at the same time as the other key: use it as a prefix
character and type it separately and distinctly. If you lean on it it's
likely to autorepeat (like any other key) and you'll get very confused.

A true `Meta` is a wonderful thing for Emacs (it makes typing much
faster), but it is possible to use `ESC` for years with no trouble.

Files, Buffers and Windows
--------------------------

Emacs has three data structures that are intimately related, and very
important to understand:

-   **[File](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Files) :**
    A file is the actual Unix file on disk. You are never editing this
    file. Rather, you can read a copy into Emacs to initialize a buffer,
    and write a copy of a buffer out to a file to save it.
-   **[Buffer](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Buffers)
    :**
    A buffer is the internal data structure that holds the text you
    actually edit. Emacs can have any number of buffers active at any
    moment. Most, but by no means all, buffers are associated with a
    file. Buffers have names; a buffer that has been initialized from a
    file is almost always named for that file, and we say that the
    buffer is *visiting* the file. This means, in particular, that when
    you save the buffer, it's saved to the proper file. At any given
    time exactly one buffer is *selected*: this is the buffer that your
    hardware cursor is in, and this is where commands you type take
    effect (including self-insert commands). Buffers can be deleted at
    will; deleting a buffer in no way deletes the file on disk (though
    you may lose any editing changes you made if you don't save first).
-   **[Window](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Windows)
    :**
    A window is your view of a buffer. Due to limited screen
    real-estate, you may not have room to view all your buffers at once.
    You can split the screen, horizontally or vertically, into as many
    windows as you like (or at least have room for), each viewing a
    different buffer. It's also possible to have several windows viewing
    different portions of the same buffer. Windows can be created and
    deleted at will; deleting a window in no way deletes the buffer
    associated with the window. Each window has its own Mode Line, but
    there's still only one minibuffer.

### Commands to Manipulate Files

-   **`C-x C-f` :**
    `find-file`. This is the main command used to read a file into a
    buffer for editing. When you execute this command, it prompts you
    for the name of the file (with [completion](#completion)). Then it
    checks to see if you're already editing that file in some buffer; if
    you are, it simply switches to that buffer and doesn't actually read
    in the file from disk again. If you're not, a new buffer is created,
    named for the file, and initialized with a copy of the file. In
    either case the current window is switched to view this buffer.
-   **`C-x C-s` :**
    `save-buffer`. This is the main command used to save a file, or,
    more accurately, to write a copy of the current buffer out to the
    disk, overwriting the buffer's file, and handling backup versions.
-   **`C-x s` :**
    `save-some-buffers`. Allows you to save all your buffers that are
    visiting files, querying you for each one and offering several
    options for each (save it, don't save it, peek at it first then
    maybe save it, etc).

### Commands to Manipulate Buffers

-   **`C-x b` :**
    `switch-to-buffer`. Prompts for a buffer name and switches the
    buffer of the current window to that buffer. Doesn't change your
    window configuration. This command will also create a *new* empty
    buffer if you type a new name; this new buffer will not be visiting
    any file, no matter what you name it.
-   **`C-x C-b` :**
    `list-buffers`. Pops up a new window which lists all your buffers,
    giving for each the name, modified or not, size in bytes, major mode
    and the file the buffer is visiting.

### Commands to Manipulate Windows

-   **`C-v` :**
    `scroll-up`. The basic command to scroll forward (toward the end of
    the file) one screenful. By default Emacs leaves you two lines of
    context from the previous screen.
-   **`M-v` :**
    `scroll-down`. Just like `C-v`, but scrolls backward.
-   **`C-x o` :**
    `other-window`. Switch to another window, making it the active
    window. Repeated invocation of this command moves through all the
    windows, left to right and top to bottom, and then circles around
    again. Under a windowing system, you can use the left mouse button
    to switch windows.
-   **`C-x 1` :**
    `delete-other-windows`. Deletes all other windows except the current
    one, making one window on the screen. Note that this in no way
    deletes the buffers or files associated with the deleted windows.
-   **`C-x 0` :**
    `delete-window`. Deletes just the current window, resizing the
    others appropriately.
-   **`C-x 2` :**
    `split-window-vertically`. Splits the current window in two,
    vertically. This creates a new window, but *not* a new buffer: the
    same buffer will now be viewed in the two windows. This allows you
    to view two different parts of the same buffer simultaneously.
-   **`C-x 3` :**
    `split-window-horizontally`. Splits the current window in two,
    horizontally. This creates a new window, but *not* a new buffer: the
    same buffer will now be viewed in the two windows. This allows you
    to view two different parts of the same buffer simultaneously.
-   **`C-M-v` :**
    `scroll-other-window`. Just like `C-v`, but scrolls the *other*
    window. If you have more than two windows, the other window is the
    window that `C-o` would switch to.

Fundamental Concepts
--------------------

It's probably more important to understand these fundamental Emacs
concepts than it is to understand any of the actual editing commands.
The editing commands are details: you can learn them easily on your own
if you get the groundwork right.

### Entering and Exiting

To enter emacs, you just say:

    emacs

when it comes up, you won't be editing any file. You can then use the
file commands to read in files for editing. Alternatively, you can fire
up Emacs with an initial file (or files) by saying:

    emacs newfile.txt

To exit emacs, use the command `C-x C-c`. It will offer to save all your
buffers and then exit.

You can also *suspend* Emacs (in the Unix sense of stopping it and
putting it in the background) with `C-x C-z` (which is bound to
`suspend-emacs`). How you restart it is up to your shell, but is
probably based on the `fg` command.

### Self Inserting Commands

Once you've got Emacs running, you can type into it.

### The Mode Line

The emacs screen is completely devoted to the text of your file, except
for one line near the bottom of the screen: the mode line. This line is
informational: you can never move into it. It's almost always in reverse
video or otherwise highlighted. It displays important information (which
may change), including:

-   The *state* of the buffer, one of modified (indicated by a pair of
    asterisks), unmodified (hyphens), or read-only (indicated by a pair
    of `%` signs).
-   The name of the file you're editing (it will be `*scratch*` if
    you're not editing any file).
-   The major mode (in purines).
-   The amount of the file that you can see on the screen:
    -   **All:**
        You can see all of the file.
    -   **Top:**
        You can see the top of the file.
    -   **Bot:**
        You can see the bottom of the file.
    -   **Percentage:**
        NV% indicates the percentage of the file above the top of the
        window.

#### The Minibuffer

The blank line below the mode line is the *minibuffer*. The minibuffer
is used by Emacs to display messages, and also for input when Emacs is
prompting you to type something (it may want you to type yes or no in
answer to a question, the name of a file to be edited, the long name of
a command, etc).

### Strange Messages

Emacs will occasionally print messages in the minibuffer of its own
accord, seemingly unrelated to what you're doing. The two most common
messages are "Mark set" and "Garbage collecting...". The former means
that Emacs has set the mark for you as a result of your last command;
automatic mark setting is a convenient feature of some commands; see
[The Mark and The Region](#region). The latter means that Emacs' lisp
engine is reclaiming storage. You can just ignore it and keep typing, if
you like: Emacs won't lose your characters.

#### Long Lines

Emacs doesn't break lines for you automatically, unless you ask it to.
By default it lets lines be as long as you type them.

It may seem annoying to have to hit return at the end of long lines, but
this is actually just the default for certain modes. The reason for this
is that Emacs is a programmer's editor, and any editor that will insert
line breaks without your telling it to isn't safe for editing code or
data. In modes oriented towards text, Emacs does insert line breaks for
you (Auto fill is such a mode)

### Interrupting and Aborting

Sometimes Emacs will do something that you don't understand: it will
prompt you for some information, or beep when you try to type, or
something equally confusing. This just means that you've typed some
command unwittingly (hitting a random function key is a good way to
demonstrate this).

When this happens, you just need to type `C-g`, which interrupts what
Emacs is doing. This will get you out of any questions that Emacs may be
asking you, and it will abort a partially typed key sequence (say if you
typed C-x by mistake).

Because Emacs is fully recursive, you may occasionally need to type
`C-g` more than once, to back out of a recursive sequence of commands.
Also, if Emacs is really wedged (say, in a network connection to some
machine which is down), typing three `C-g`'s quickly is guaranteed to
abort whatever's wedging you.

### Help

Emacs has extensive online help, most of which is available when you
press ESC, and thereafter help.

-   **`ESC help a` :**
    `command-apropos`. Prompts for a keyword and then lists all the
    commands with that keyword in their long name.
-   **`ESC help k` :**
    `describe-key`. Prompts for a keystroke and describes the command
    bound to that key, if any.
-   **`ESC help i` :**
    `info`. Enters the Info hypertext documentation reader.
-   **`ESC help m` :**
    `describe-mode`. Describes the current major mode and its particular
    key bindings.
-   **`ESC help p` :**
    `finder-by-keyword`. Runs an interactive subject-oriented browser of
    Emacs packages.
-   **`ESC help t` :**
    `help-with-tutorial`. Run the Emacs tutorial. This is very helpful
    for beginners.

### Info

Emacs has a builtin hypertext documentation reader, called
[*Info*](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Misc%20Help) . To
run it, type `ESC help i` or `M-x info RET`. It has it's own tutorial,
which you should run the first time through by typing `h`. The tutorial
assumes you understand about as much about Emacs as is covered in this
document.

### Infinite Undo with Redo

One of the most important Emacs commands is
[`undo`](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Undo) , invoked
with `C-_` (control underbar). `C-_` is a valid ASCII character, but
some keyboards don't generate it, so you can also use `C-x u` -- but
it's more awkward to type, since it's a two-character command.

The undo command allows you to undo your editing, back in time. It's
handy when you accidentally convert all of a huge file to uppercase,
say, or delete a huge amount of text. One keystroke changes everything
back to normal.

We say Emacs has infinite undo because, unlike some editors, you can
undo a long chain of commands, not just one previous one, even undoing
through saves. We say Emacs has redo because you can reverse direction
while undoing, thereby undoing the undo.

Once you get used to this feature you'll laugh at any editor that
doesn't have it (unless you're forced to use it...). It's very important
to get comfortable with undo as soon as possible; I recommend reading
[the undo section of the
manual](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Undo) carefully
and practicing.

### Backups and Auto Save Mode

Emacs never modifies your file on disk until you tell it to, but it's
very careful about saving your work for you in a number of ways.

-   **[Backup
    files](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Backup).:**
    Emacs always saves the previous version of your file when you save.
    If your file is named `foo`, the backup will be called `foo~` (note
    the squiggle). Although it is off by default, Emacs will keep any
    number of previous versions for you, named `foo.~1~`, `foo.~2~`,
    etc. You can decide how many versions are to be kept. (But Unix
    provides more powerful tools for managing multiple versions of
    files.)
-   **[Auto-Save
    files](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Auto%20Save).:**
    Emacs also, be default, *auto-saves* your file while you're editing
    it. The auto-save file for a file `foo` is called `#foo#`. If Emacs
    (or the system) were to crash before you could save your edits, you
    can recover almost all of it from this file. Auto-saving happens (by
    default) every 300 characters, or when a system error is
    encountered.

### Completion

To save you typing, Emacs offers various forms of
[*completion*](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Completion)
: this means Emacs tries to complete for you partially typed file names,
command names, etc. To invoke completion, you usually type `TAB`.

### Giving Commands Arguments

Many Emacs commands take
[*arguments*](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Arguments) ,
exactly the way a procedure or function takes arguments in a programming
language. Most commands prompt you for their arguments: e.g., a command
to read in a file will prompt you for the filename.

There's one kind of argument that's so commonly accepted that there's a
special way to provide it: *numeric arguments*. Many commands will
interpret a numeric argument as a request to repeat that many times. For
example, the `delete-char` command (bound to `C-d`), which normally
deletes one character to the right of the cursor, will delete *N*
characters if given a numeric argument of *N*. It works with
self-inserting commands too: try giving a numeric argument to a printing
character, like a hyphen.

To give a command a numeric argument of, say, 12, type `C-u 12` before
typing the command. If you type slowly, you'll see:

    C-u 1 2-

in the echo area. Then type `C-d` and you'll have given `delete-char` an
argument of 12. You can type any number of digits after `C-u`. A leading
hyphen makes a negative argument; a lone hyphen is the same as an
argument of -1. If you begin typing a numeric argument and change your
mind, you can of course type `C-g` to abort it.

Since one often isn't interested in *precisely* how many times a command
is repeated, there's a shorthand way to get numeric arguments of varying
magnitudes. `C-u` by itself, without any subsequent digits, is equal to
a numeric argument of 4. Another `C-u` multiplies that by 4 more, giving
a numeric argument of 16. Another `C-u` multiplies *that* by 4 more,
giving a numeric argument of 64, etc. For this reason `C-u` is called
the `universal-argument`.

Note that commands aren't *required* to interpret numeric arguments as
specifying repetitions. It depends on what's appropriate: some commands
ignore numeric arguments, some interpret them as Boolean (the presence
of numeric argument -- *any* numeric argument -- as opposed to its
absence), etc. Read the documentation for a command before trying it.

### Quoting Characters That Are Bound As Commands

Sometimes one needs to insert control characters into a file. But how
can you insert an `ESC`, say, when it's used as a prefix command? The
answer is to use the command
[`quoted-insert`](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Inserting%20Text)
, which is bound to `C-q`. `C-q` acts like a prefix command, in that
when you type it it waits for you to type another character. But this
next character is then inserted into the buffer, rather than being
executed as a command. So `C-q ESC` inserts an `Escape`.

`C-q` can also be used to insert characters by typing `C-q` followed by
their ASCII code as three octal digits.

### Disabled Commands

Some commands that are especially confusing for novices are
[disabled](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Disabling) by
default. When a command is disabled, invoking it subjects you to a brief
dialog, popping up a window displaying the documentation for the
command, and giving you three choices:

-   Space to try the command just this once, but leave it disabled,
-   Y to try it and enable it (no questions if you use it again),
-   N to do nothing (command remains disabled).

You're very likely to encounter one particular disabled command: `M-ESC`
(aka `ESC ESC`), because it's very easy to type two escapes in a row
when using the `Escape` prefix.

Motion and Objects
------------------

One of the main things one does in an editor is [move
around](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Moving%20Point),
in order to apply editing commands. Emacs provides many motion commands,
which are arranged around *textual objects*: for each textual object,
there is typically a motion command that moves forward over such an
object and backward over it (or you can think of this as moving to the
beginning and to the end).

All these motion commands take numeric arguments as repetitions.

The most basic textual object is the character. Emacs understand many
other objects, sometimes depending on what mode you're in (a C function
textual object probably doesn't make much sense if you're not editing C
source code).

The exact definition of what makes up a given textual object is often
customizable, but more importantly varies slightly from mode to mode.
The characters that make up a word in Text Mode may not be exactly the
same as those that make up a word in C Mode for example. (E.g.,
underbars are considered word constituents in C Mode, because they are
legal in identifier names, but they aren't considered word constituents
in Text Mode.) This is extremely useful, because it means that you can
use the same motion commands and yet have them automatically customized
for different types of text.

### Characters

-   **`C-f` :**
    `forward-char`. Moves forward (to the right) over a character.
-   **`C-b` :**
    `backward-char`. Moves backward (to the left) over a character.

The f for forward and b for backward mnemonic will reoccur.

### Words

-   **`M-f` :**
    `forward-word`. Moves forward over a word.
-   **`M-b` :**
    `backward-word`. Moves backward over a word.

Note the f/b mnemonic. Also, as another mnemonic, note that `M-f` is
like a "bigger" version of `C-f`.

### Lines (vertically)

-   **`C-n` :**
    `next-line`. Moves down to the next line.
-   **`C-p` :**
    `previous-line`. Moves up to the previous line.

When moving by lines, the cursor tries to stay in the same column, but
if the new line is too short, it will be at the end of the line instead.
This is very important: Emacs doesn't insert spaces at the ends of lines
(end of line is unambiguous).

### Lines (horizontally)

-   **`C-a` :**
    `beginning-of-line`. Moves to the beginning of the current line.
-   **`C-e` :**
    `end-of-line`. Moves to the end of the current line.

E for end, A for the beginning of the alphabet.

### Sentences

-   **`M-a` :**
    `backward-sentence`. Moves to the beginning of the current sentence.
-   **`M-e` :**
    `forward-sentence`. Moves to the end of the current sentence.

Note the mnemonic relation between `C-a` / `M-a` and `C-e` / `M-e`.

### Paragraphs

-   **`M-{` :**
    `backward-paragraph`. Move to the beginning of the current
    paragraph.
-   **`M-}` :**
    `forward-paragraph`. Move to the end of the current paragraph.

### Pages

-   **`C-x [` :**
    `backward-page`. Moves to the beginning of the current page.
-   **`C-x ]` :**
    `forward-page`. Moves to the end of the current page.

Pages are separated by formfeed characters (`C-l`) in most modes.

### Buffers

-   **`M-<` :**
    `beginning-of-buffer`. Moves to the beginning of the buffer.
-   **`M->` :**
    `end-of-buffer`. Moves to the end of the buffer.

### S-Expressions (balanced parentheses)

An
[*S-expression*](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)List%20Commands)
(*sexp* for short) is the name for balanced parentheses (and the text
they enclose) in Lisp. In Emacs, this useful notion is available in most
modes; it's especially useful for editing programming languages. The
characters that Emacs recognizes as parens are usually regular
parentheses (aka round brackets), square brackets, and braces (aka curly
brackets), but it depends on the mode (for some languages, angle
brackets may act as parens).

But sexps are more than just balanced parens: they're defined
recursively. A word that doesn't contain any parens also counts as a
sexp. In most programming language modes, quoted strings are sexps
(using either single or double quotes, depending on the syntax of the
language). The sexp commands move in terms of all these units.

These commands may seem confusing at first, but for editing most
programming languages they're fantastic. Not only do they move you
around quickly and accurately, but they help spot syntax errors while
you're editing, because they'll generate an error if your parens or
quotes are unbalanced.

-   **`C-M-b` :**
    `backward-sexp`. Moves backward over the next sexp. If your cursor
    is just to the right of a left paren, `C-M-b` will beep, because
    there's no sexp to the left to move over: you have to move *up*.
-   **`C-M-f` :**
    `forward-sexp`. Moves forward over the next sexp. Same deal if your
    cursor is just to the left of a right paren.
-   **`C-M-u` :**
    `backward-up-list`. Move backward up one level of parens. In other
    words, move to the left paren of the parens containing the cursor,
    skipping balanced sexps.
-   **`C-M-d` :**
    `down-list`. Move down one level of parens. In other words, move to
    the right of the next left paren, skipping balanced sexps. E.g., if
    your cursor is sitting on the return type of a C function
    declaration, `C-M-d` moves to the inside of the formal parameter
    list.

### Functions

Since [functions](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Defuns)
are such an important unit of text in programming languages, whether
they're called functions, subroutines, procedures, procs, defuns or
whatever, Emacs has commands to move over them. Like the sexp commands,
these commands work appropriately in most programming language modes.
Emacs calls this generic notion of function or procedure *defun*, again
after Lisp.

-   **`C-M-a` :**
    `beginning-of-defun`. Move to the beginning of the current defun.
-   **`C-M-e` :**
    `end-of-defun`. Move to the end of the current defun.

Note the mnemonic analogy with lines and sentences.

Deleting, Killing and Yanking
-----------------------------

Emacs' deletion commands are also based on the textual objects above.
But first, a terminological distinction: *Deletion* means to remove text
from the buffer without saving it; most deletion commands operate on
small amounts of text. *Killing* means to save the removed text, so that
it can be yanked back later someplace else. So, "Deletion" is permanent,
"Killing" is deletion that can be undone, and "yanking" is the emacs
term for paste.

Killed text is saved on what is called the kill ring. The kill ring
holds the last *N* kills, where *N* is 30 by default, but you can change
it to anything you like by changing the value of the variable
`kill-ring-max`. The kill ring acts like a fifo when you're killing
things (after the 30th kill, kill number one is gone), but like a ring
when you're yanking things back (you can yank around the ring
circularly). `kill-ring-max` doesn't apply to the amount of text (in
bytes) that can be saved in the kill ring (there's no limit), only to
the number of distinct kills.

### Characters

-   **`C-d` :**
    `delete-char`. Deletes the character to the right of (under, if the
    cursor is a block that covers a character) the cursor.
-   **`DEL` :**
    `delete-backward-char`. Deletes the character to the left of the
    cursor.

### Words

-   **`M-d` :**
    `kill-word`. Kills to the end of the word to the right of the cursor
    (forward).
-   **`M-DEL` :**
    `backward-kill-word`. Kills to the beginning of the word to the left
    of the cursor (backward).

### Lines (horizontally)

-   **`C-k` :**
    `kill-line`. Kills to the end of the current line, not including the
    newline. Thus, if you're at the beginning of a line it takes two
    `C-k`'s to kill the whole line and close up the whitespace.
-   **`C-u 0 C-k` :**
    `kill-line`. Kills to the beginning of the current line, not
    including the newline.

You might think that `C-u -1 C-k` would be used to kill to the beginning
of the line, and it does, but it includes the newline before the line as
well.

### Sentences

-   **`M-k` :**
    `kill-sentence`. Kills to the end of the current sentence, including
    any newline within the sentence.
-   **`C-u -1 M-k` :**
    `kill-sentence`. Kills to the beginning of the current sentence,
    including any newlines within the sentence.

### Paragraphs

The commands `forward-kill-paragraph` and `backward-kill-paragraph`
exist, but are not bound to any keys by default.

-   **`C-M-k` :**
    `kill-sexp`. Kills the sexp after the cursor.
-   **`C-u -1 C-M-k` :**
    `kill-sexp`. Kills the sexp before the cursor.

The command `backward-kill-sexp` exists, but is not bound to any key by
default.

### Extending Kills

If you kill several times in a row, with any combination of kill
commands, but without any *non*-kill commands in between, these kills
are appended together in one entry on the kill ring. For example you can
kill a block of text as several lines by saying `C-u 6 C-k`, which kills
(as one kill) 6 lines.

### Yanking (what other programs call "paste"

Once you've killed some text, how do you get it back? You can yank back
the most recently killed text with `C-y` (`yank`). Since Emacs has only
one kill ring (as opposed to one per buffer), you can kill in one
buffer, switch to another and yank the text there.

To get back previous kills, you move around the kill ring. Start with
`C-y` to get the most recent kill, and then use `M-y` to move to the
previous spot in the kill ring by replacing the just-yanked text with
the previous kill. Subsequent `M-y`'s move around the ring, each time
replacing the yanked text. When you reach the text you you're interested
in, just stop. Any other command (a motion command, self-insert,
anything) breaks the cycling of the kill ring, and the next `C-y` yanks
the most recent kill again.

Copying and Moving Text
-----------------------

Emacs has no need for special commands to copy or move text; you've
already learned them! To move text, just kill it and yank it back
elsewhere. To copy text, kill it, yank it back immediately (so it's as
if you haven't killed it, except it's now in the kill ring), move
elsewhere and yank it back again. For commands to copy and move
arbitrary regions of text, as opposed to textual objects, see [The Mark
and The Region](#region).

Searching and Replacing
-----------------------

Emacs has a variety of unusual and extremely powerful search and replace
commands. The most important one is called *incremental search*. This is
what the command `C-s`, does: it searches incrementally, one character
at a time, as you type the search string. This means that Emacs can
often find what you're looking for before you have to type the whole
thing. To stop searching, you can either hit `RET` or type any other
Emacs command (which will both stop the search and execute the command).
You can search for the next match at any point by typing another `C-s`
at any point; you can reverse the search (search backwards) by typing
`C-r`; and you can use `DEL` to delete and change what you're searching
for.

`C-r`, works the same way, but searches backward. (Use `C-r` to search
for the next match and `C-s` to reverse the search.)

Another possibility is *word search*, which lets you search for a
sequence of one or more words, regardless of how they're separated (e.g,
by any number and combination of newlines and whitespace). To invoke
word search, type `C-s RET C-w word word word RET`.

Emacs can also search incrementally (or not) by regular expressions. The
command is `C-u-s`, and it understands [regular
expressions](../ling/docu-regexps.html).

### Replacement

Emacs' most important command for replacing text is called
`query-replace` (bound to `M-%`, type **ESC**, and thereafter **%**).
This command prompts you for the text to replace, and the text to
replace it with, and then searches and replaces within the current
buffer. `query-replace` is interactive: at each match, you are prompted
to decide what to do; you have the following options:

-   **`SPC` :**
    Perform this replacement.
-   **`DEL` :**
    Don't perform this replacement.
-   **`RET` :**
    Terminate `query-replace` without performing this replacement.
-   **`ESC` :**
    Same as `RET`.
-   **`.` :**
    Perform this replacement but then terminate the `query-replace`.
-   **`!` :**
    Perform this replacement and all the rest in the buffer without
    querying (ie unconditionally).

There are many more subcommands, but they require more Emacs expertise
to understand them.

There are also more replacement commands you should look into, including
`replace-string` (simple unconditional replacement), `replace-regexp`
and `query-replace-regexp` (which use regular expressions), and
`tags-query-replace`, which replaces all identifiers in a collection of
source code files.

`query-replace-regexp` is **very important** to us. The shortest way to
type it is **ESC que TAB - TAB**. If you e.g. want to add the text **K
;** to the end of each line of the rest of the file, type **ESC que TAB
- TAB**, then **$ RET** (dollar followed by return, dollar means
end-of-line), then **K ;** followed by return.

`query-replace` and the other replacement commands are, by default,
smart about case. For example, if you're replacing `foo` with `bar` and
find `Foo`, Emacs replaces it with `Bar`; if you find `FOO`, Emacs
replaces it with `BAR`, etc.

The Mark and The Region
-----------------------

Emacs can manipulate arbitrary chunks of text as well as distinct
textual objects. The way this is done is to define a *region* of text;
many commands will operate on this region. this is what you do with the
mouse in ordinary word processors.

The region is the text between *point* and *mark*. Point is actually the
Emacs term for what we've been calling the cursor up to now. The mark,
on the other hand, is set with a special command `C-SPACEBAR`
(mellomromstasten, välilyönti) (`set-mark-command`). This sets the mark
exactly where point is, but now you can move point elsewhere and you
have: the region.

The region is the same regardless of whether point comes first in the
buffer or mark does; it makes no difference, just do what's convenient.

Many commands that move point a significant distance (like `M-<` and
`C-s`, for example) leave the mark set at the spot they moved from.
You'll see "Mark set" in the echo area when this happens.

When using Emacs under a windowing system like X, the mouse can be used
to sweep out the region, but many Emacsers find it faster to keep their
hands on the keyboard and use the familiar motion commands.

So now you know how to define the region: what can you do with it?

-   **`C-x C-x` :**
    `exchange-point-and-mark`. Swaps mark and point. Repeated rapid
    execution of this command makes it easy to see the extent of the
    region.
-   **`C-w` :**
    `kill-region`. Kills the region. It goes on the kill ring, of
    course.
-   **`M-w` :**
    `kill-ring-save`. Saves the region to the kill ring without removing
    it from the buffer. This is exactly equivalent to typing `C-w C-y`.
-   **`C-x C-i` :**
    `indent-rigidly`. Rigidly indents the region by as many characters
    (columns) as you provide as a numeric argument (default is 1
    column).
-   **`C-x C-l` :**
    `downcase-region`. Convert the entire region to lowercase. This
    command is disabled by default.
-   **`C-x C-u` :**
    `upcase-region`. Convert the entire region to uppercase. This
    command is disabled by default.
-   **`M-x fill-region` :**
    `fill-region`. Fills, i.e., justifies with a ragged right margin,
    all the paragraphs within the region.

There are many, many more.

Modes
-----

The main way Emacs customizes commands for different kinds of text is
through major and minor modes. Every buffer has a major mode, and may
have zero or more minor modes. Sometimes Emacs chooses a major mode for
you automatically, typically based on a file extension (e.g., files
ending in `.c` will automatically be in C Mode; files ending in `.tcl`
will automatically be in Tcl Mode). But you can always set the mode
explicitly.

### Some Major Modes

-   **`Fundamental Mode` :**
    The basic mode in reference to which all specialized modes are
    defined. Perfectly fine for editing any kind of text, just doesn't
    provide any special features.
-   **`Text Mode` :**
    For editing text. Has special commands for spell-checking, centering
    lines, etc.
-   **`HTML helper mode` :**
    for writing html files. It is automatically turned on when you open
    a file with a name that ends in ".html".

There are many other major modes, some very specialized (e.g., modes for
editing sending email, reading Usenet news, browsing directories,
browsing the World Wide Web, etc).

### Entering characters in Emacs

-   **`ISO Latin characters` :**
    -   Type `C-q` followed by the octal code of the character. For
        example, `C-q 341 RET` gives the lower case a with acute (á).
    -   First load the iso-insert library: give the command
        `M-x load-library` and respond to prompt with `iso-insert`. Then
        use commands `M-x insert-A-acute` for inserting capital A with
        acute (á).
-   **`UTF-8 characters` :**
    -   First load library `un-define`
    -   Insert unicode characters by `M-x insert-ucs-character` and
        giving the character's unicode number.
