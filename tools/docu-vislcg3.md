Vislcg3 is the newest parser generation from Odense. As its predecessor,
vislcg, it is open source. Vislcg3 is licensed under GPL.

Starting on March 5th 2008, we have migrated to vislcg3. Rule files for
vislcg are still available in older revisions. For vislcg3 documentation
we recommend the online documentation at
[beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3.html](http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3.html). Here, we
only document installation and basic usage.

Installation
============

Mac OS X
--------

-   Check if you have [MacPorts](/infra/MacPorts.html). Issue the
    command `/opt/local/bin/port search twig` in a Terminal. If that is
    successfull, go on to the next step. If not [install
    MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/install.php), then issue the
    following commands in your terminal window:

<!-- -->

              sudo port install cmake
              sudo port install boost
              sudo port install icu
              cd /tmp
              svn co http://visl.sdu.dk/svn/visl/tools/vislcg3/trunk vislcg3
              cd vislcg3/
              ./cmake.sh --prefix=/usr/local
              make -j3
              ./test/runall.pl
              sudo make install

The vislcg3 site has [more info on Mac OS
installation](http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/installation.html)
(including instructions for HomeBrew users), but note that we for our
Apertium work assume your vislcg3 is instlled in /usr/local and not in
/opt/local.

Other operating systems
-----------------------

The vislcg3 site has installation instructions for Linux and Windows

Compilation and usage of CG files
=================================

The CG .rle files can be run as text files, or comiled. They will be
compiled with the `make             TARGET=$LANG` command d:

`... | vislcg3 -g src/sme-dis.rle | ...`

Vislcg3 can be run with this command:

`... | vislcg3 -g src/sme-dis.rle | ...`

Flags
=====

The list of flags can be obtained by vislcg3 --help. That command prints
something like this (use the newest version rather than this list):

    -bash-3.00$ vislcg3 -h
    VISL CG-3 Disambiguator version 0.9.2.3279
