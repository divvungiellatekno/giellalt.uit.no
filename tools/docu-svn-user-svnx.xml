         <title>Initial setup and checkout</title>
         <p>Open the repository window (<strong>Window &gt; Repository</strong>), and fill in the details for our
         repository:<br /> <img alt="checkout menu item" src="images/svnx-repositorylist.png" /></p>
         <p>Double-click the repository entry you just made (see picture above). In the new window that opens, click on
         the button <strong>Checkout</strong>:<br /> <img alt="SvnX repository viiew"
         src="images/svnx-repositoryview-checkoutbutton.png" /></p>
         <p>If you already have checked out (e.g. on the command line), just fill in the details directly in the
         <strong>Working Copies</strong> window (see below).</p>

         <title>Working with the local source code</title>
         <p>In the directory that you did the checkout in, you will now have a directory called <code>langtech</code>
         where all our code is contained. The whole working copy is listed in the Working Copies window (<strong>Windows
         &gt; Working Copies</strong>):<br /> <img alt="List of working copies" src="images/svnx-wclist.png" /></p>
         <p>Double click the corresponding line, and you will get a window listing the current state of your working
         copy:<br /><img alt="Working copy window" src="images/svnx-wcview.png" /></p>
         <p>Highlight a file<br /><img alt="Working copy view with highlighted file"
         src="images/svnx-wcview-highlight.png" /><br />and click <strong>Diff</strong> to get a visual presentation of
         your modifications compared to the untouched version:<br /><img alt="Visual diff opened in FileMerge"
         src="images/svnx-filemergediff.png" width="80%" /></p>
         <p>Click the <strong>Reviewâ€¦</strong> button to get a list of only the modified files, a log message text
         field, and a diff view. This makes it easy to review and commit a number of related files at once, and also to
         remember what the changes were all about - just click the relevant file, and the diff will be displayed. Only
         checked files will be commited.<br /><img
