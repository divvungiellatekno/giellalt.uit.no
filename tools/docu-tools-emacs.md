How to use emacs for our purposes
=================================

Adding words, one by one

Adding many words to the lexicon
--------------------------------

Typically, we have a long list of words, (several tens of thousands). Do
a reverse sort on that list. If it is called **newwords**, give the
command **rev newwords \| sort \| rev &gt; r-newwords**.

Take out a set of lines that behave the same way, e.g. all ending in
"njárga". Make a new file, **C-x C-f njarga1**, and another file
**njarga2**. The file njarga1 should contain everything before the ":"
mark, and the file njarga2 everything after the ":" mark. Cf. the line:

Stuoranjár0ga:Stuoranjár'ga GOAHTI ;

The file njarga1 should contain entries like

Stuoranjár0ga

and the file njarga2 should contain entries like

Stuoranjár'ga GOAHTI ;

So, starting out with a list containing words like "Stuoranjárga",
change the entries in njarga1 to "Stuoranjár0ga", and the entries in
njarga2 to "Stuoranjar'ga GOAHTI ;". Use the command **M-x queTAB-TAB**.

Save both files, and leave emacs.

Then you should **paste** these two files together. To do that, on the
command line write the command

paste -d":" njarga1 njarga2 \| less

**-d** tells that you want to use a separator mark, and the mark you
want to use (:) must be in quotation marks. Then comes the file (the
leftmost file first), and since you want to control the output, you
should write **\| less**. If everything works, you should replace the
last part with a command that creates a new file (e.g. named **&gt;
2njarga**), or, if you know what you are doing, you should just add it
directly to the file where you want it, with the **&gt;&gt;** operator.

paste -d":" njarga1 njarga2 &gt; 2njarga

or

paste -d":" njarga1 njarga2 &gt;&gt; propernoun-sme-lex.txt
