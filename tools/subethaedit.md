About SubEthaEdit (SEE)
=======================

SubEthaEdit, named after a famous net in The Hitchhiker's guide to the
galaxy (SubEthaNet â€” long before Internet was invented), is a standard
text editor, just like TextEdit, NotePad, or whatever - *except* that it
allows instant and easy collaboration and concurrent editing. What you
see is what the other person does - WYSIWTOPD - instantly, everywhere.
It is perfect for writing meeting memos together, for debugging
together, for collaborative article writing etc. Getting the other buddy
into your document is as easy as drag-and-drop.

We have bought a site version of SubEthaEdit for this project. Talk to
Trond.

You can also download a 30-day trial from the [SEE
website](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/), or try out [the free
2.2 version of SEE](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/old.html)
(which unfortunately doesn't seem to be compatible with the latest
versions of MacOS X (Lion and Snow Leopard).

SEE server
==========

We have installed SubEthaEdit on our main server, such that a number of
shared documents are always available for everyone to use. This is
especially nice when everyone collaborating is behind a firewall or NAT.
Just click on the following link: [see://divvun.no](see://divvun.no).

SubEthaEdit settings
====================

Under the first menu (SubEthaEdit), choose "preferences", and the tab
"Editing". "Default encoding" should be "UTF-8" and "Line endings"
should be "Unix (LF)". "Highligth Syntax", "Show matching brackets",
"Show line numbers" and "Wrap lines by word" are nice choices as well.

On the "Printing" tab, "Show line numbers" is a good choice.

On the "Advanced" tabs, install the command line tools.

Syntax modes
============

We have made a number of modes available for the formal languages we
use, like `twolc`, `xfst`, `lexc` etc. Have a look in
`$GTHOME/tools/see-tools/`. These modes will help you in editing the
most common document formats in use. A number of other modes are
available from the [SEE modes
page](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/modes.html).

Usage
=====

Basic usage of SubEthaEdit requires no tutorial. Just write, erase, and
move around with the arrow keys. But SubEthaEdit may be a much more
efficient tool. Here are some hints:

-   Most basic emacs commands work in SubEthaEdit. Cf. the list below,
    where "C-a" means "hold down the `ctrl `key and press `A`"
    -   **C-a, C-e, C-p, C-n:**  
        Beginning of line, end of line, previous line, next line

    <!-- -->

    -   **C-k, C-d:**  
        Delete the rest of the line, delete the next character
-   Ordinary Macintosh commands work (command and then x, c, v, z, a for
    cut, copy, paste, undo and select all
-   The Find/Replace command supports *regular expressions*
-   Have a look at the "Settings" options in the SubEthaEdit menu. Make
    "Show line numbers" and "Show matching parenthese" default.

SubEthaEdit as a collaborative editor
=====================================

This is where SEE really shines, even today, with a lot of online
pastebins available. You may invite other people into your document. Do
as follows:

1.  On the top of the document, press the yellow **Announce** symbol on
    the top left corner of the document (or press **Cmd-Shift-E**).
2.  In the pop-up window to the right, your name will appear. Above it,
    change Locked to **Read/Write** (or press **Cmd-Shift-A**).
3.  Make the **Connections** window visible by going to **Windows &gt;
    Connections** (or by pressing **Cmd-K**).
4.  To invite other SEE users to your document, **EITHER**:
    -   drag their **iChat** buddy icon to the **Connections** window -
        SEE will prepare a chat with the correct SEE link; **OR**:
    -   drag the blue ball *from* the **Connections** window *to* an
        existing chat or other communications channel - a clickable link
        will appear where you drop the ball
