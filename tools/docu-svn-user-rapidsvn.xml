    <title>How to use RapidSVN</title>

      <title>Basic usage</title>

      <p>This is for users wanting a graphical user interface to svn, like the
      program CVL used for cvs. Users accustomed to the command line (and
      comments such as <code>cvs up</code> etc. may safely ignore this chapter,
      and stick to the previous one.</p>

      <p>Choose Repository-&gt;Checkout... <br /> <img alt="checkout menu item"

      <p>Write <code>https://victorio.uit.no/repos</code> into the URL box.
      Choose the map where you would like to place the files in the Destination
      Directory box (we suggest adding <strong>repos</strong> to the end of the
      path, to keep svn maps in a separate place), then press OK.<br /> <img

      <p>Press "Permanently" when the SSL Certificate dialog appears. <br />

      <title>Working with the repository</title>

      <p>In the directory that you did the checkout you will now have a
      directory called repos, where all our code is contained. Usually the daily
      work goes on in the <code>repos/trunk</code> directory.<br /> <img
