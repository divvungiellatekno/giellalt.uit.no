lookup
======

Intro
-----

The *lookup* tool is shortly described at the [lookup documentation
page](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis639/docs/lookup.html) at. Here is
some info on lookup that is relevant to the present project.

Flags
-----

Note the flags,

-flags mbTT

The mb flag tells that lookup accepts multicharacter input both in the
upper and lower language, which is crucial since we use UTF-8. The TT
flag tells that there is no separator between the lexeme and the tags to
follow it.
