      <title>Conversion scripts</title>

      <p>The conversion scripts are located in
      <code>$GTHOME/gt/script</code> and in
      <code>$GTHOME/giella-core/scripta</code>.
      The intention is to move all of them to giella-core.</p>

      <p>The unix utility <strong>iconv</strong> contains ready-made
      conversion routines for many code tables. The syntax is as follows:</p>

      <p>
    <code>$ iconv --from-code=ISO-8859-1 --to-code=UTF-8 &lt; old_file > new_file</code>
      </p>

      <p>A list of code tables is listed with <strong>iconv --list</strong>.</p>

      <title>Initial capital letter</title>

      <p>The most improtant caseconvertion scripts are case.regex
      (caseconv.fst). They are different form language to language, and
      located in the language-specific directories. They form an integrated
      part of the Makefiles, and the resulting parsers contain the ability
      of recognising initial capital letters.</p>

      <title>Letters in all caps (with hfst-tokenize)</title>

      <p>Hfst's combined preprocessor and morphological analyser is able to
      handle input written with capital letters. See
      <a href="../ling/preprocessor.html">this introduction to preprocessing</a>.

      <title>Letters in all caps (with xfst)</title>

      <p>Using xfst, analysing words written in all caps is not that easy.
      There is a script called allcaps.regex. By using this script,
      (&quot;Duodji&quot; is accepted, as is &quot;DUODJI&quot;,
      but &quot;DuoDji&quot; is not. These are also located in the src
      directories (so far only for sme), and are integrated in the
      Makefile. But the resulting allcaps.fst is not compiled together
      with sme.fst into a single transducer, as this would have resulted
      in a too large network. Instead, it is kept separate in the sme/bin
      directory, and when needed, it may be invoked by the following
      command (assuming you stand in gt/sme):</p>

          <p>... | lookup -flags mbTT -f src/cap-sme | ...</p>

      <p>Note that the lookup script file is located in sme/src, but the
      binary allcaps.fst that the cap-sme file refers to, is located in
      sme/bin.</p>

    <title>The spellrelax scripts</title>

    <p>South and Lule Saami have scripts to allow for different
    practices for writing <em>ï¿½</em> (as ï¿½or i) and for the
    Norwegian/Swedish ï¿½ï¿½and ï¿½ mix. These are xfst scripts,
    integrated in the makefiles of sma and smj.</p>
