      <title>How to use Versions.app</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>Initial setup</h1>
      <p>Start <strong>Versions</strong> and click one of the big buttons <strong>Repository</strong> (if you
         <em>don't</em> have a local working copy already) or <strong>Working Copy</strong> (if you <em>do</em> have a
         working copy already) - fill in the details:<br> <img alt="Versions: initial view and setup" src="images/versions-initialview.png"></p>
      <h1>Working with the local working copy</h1>
      <p>When all is set up, Versions will give you a status listing directly in the window.
         It will also indicate
         how many commits are in the repository since you last updated (2 in the picture below).
         You can switch between
         only seeing the modified (and unknown) files, or all files.<br> <img alt="Versions: view of working copy" src="images/versions-wcview.png"></p>
      <p>By turning on the inspector, it is very easy to change common attributes:<br><img alt="Versions: working copy with inspector, file selection" src="images/versions-wcviewinspector.png" width="90%"><br>or edit the ignore list:<br><img alt="Versions: working copy with inspector, folder selection" src="images/versions-wcviewinspector2.png" width="90%"></p>
      <p>Even with Versions (as compared to <a href="docu-svn-user-svnx.html">SvnX</a>), diffs will open in
         FileMerge. But Versions do a better job at providing the real working copy file, and
         with a small script (found
         in <code>$GTHOME/gt/src/filemerge-tools/</code> - run <code>make</code> there to install), all files will open
         with the correct encoding, and merges done using FileMerge will automatically be saved
         back to the working copy
         file.
      </p>

      <p>Make sure that after you have installed the script (named <code>FileMerge_SaveMergedToSecondFile.sh</code>),
         you open <strong>Versions &gt; Preferences</strong>, and select the script in the <strong>File
            Comparison</strong> drop-down menu:<br><img alt="Versions: the preferences dialog" src="images/versions-preferences.png"></p>
