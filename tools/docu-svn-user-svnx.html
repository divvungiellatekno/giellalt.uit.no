      <h1>Initial setup and checkout</h1>
      <p>Open the repository window (<strong>Window &gt; Repository</strong>), and fill in the details for our
         repository:<br> <img alt="checkout menu item" src="images/svnx-repositorylist.png"></p>
      <p>Double-click the repository entry you just made (see picture above). In the new window
         that opens, click on
         the button <strong>Checkout</strong>:<br> <img alt="SvnX repository viiew" src="images/svnx-repositoryview-checkoutbutton.png"></p>
      <p>If you already have checked out (e.g. on the command line), just fill in the details
         directly in the
         <strong>Working Copies</strong> window (see below).
      </p>
      <h1>Working with the local source code</h1>
      <p>In the directory that you did the checkout in, you will now have a directory called
         <code>langtech</code>
         where all our code is contained. The whole working copy is listed in the Working Copies
         window (<strong>Windows
            &gt; Working Copies</strong>):<br> <img alt="List of working copies" src="images/svnx-wclist.png"></p>
      <p>Double click the corresponding line, and you will get a window listing the current
         state of your working
         copy:<br><img alt="Working copy window" src="images/svnx-wcview.png"></p>
      <p>Highlight a file<br><img alt="Working copy view with highlighted file" src="images/svnx-wcview-highlight.png"><br>and click <strong>Diff</strong> to get a visual presentation of
         your modifications compared to the untouched version:<br><img alt="Visual diff opened in FileMerge" src="images/svnx-filemergediff.png" width="80%"></p>
      <p>Click the <strong>Reviewâ€¦</strong> button to get a list of only the modified files, a log message text
         field, and a diff view. This makes it easy to review and commit a number of related
         files at once, and also to
         remember what the changes were all about - just click the relevant file, and the diff
         will be displayed. Only
         checked files will be commited.<br><img alt="Review and commit, with diff highlighted directly in the commit window." src="images/svnx-wcreviewcommit.png"></p>
