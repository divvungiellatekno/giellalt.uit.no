      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The project uses the bug database program Bugzilla (general info on bugzilla can be
         found at <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org">www.bugzilla.org</a>. Our bug database is installed at the HUM-fak web server, here:

      <ul>
         <li>
            <a href="http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/">http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/</a>
            
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Following this link brings you to our bug database. It is easier to use via a graphical
         web browser (Safari, Netscape) than via lynx, although you may use it with lynx as
         well.
      </p>
      <p>If you don't have access to it yet, go to the url in question (with a graphical browser),
         and log in. Bugzilla will ask four your email address as user name, and mail you a
         password (which you may change later on). Then there is a

      <h1>Informal rules of thumb for using Bugzilla</h1>
      <ol>
         <li>If you find a bug, see if you can fix it yourself, at once.</li>
         <li>If you cannot fix it, or you cannot fix it just now, go to Bugzilla</li>
         <li>Check that the bug is not already reported, and</li>
         <li>report the bug.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>And remember that the project also has a news group server, at news.uit.no. Principled
         questions and errors without clear answers should be discussed there (you may of course
         both report a bug in bugzilla and open a discussion in the news group if you find
         that appropriate).
