In order to make programs for lingustic analysis, you need `unix`. If all
you want to do is edit the files, and not use them, you may work on
your local machine.




#  Use your Windows computer as a terminal for a remote linux machine


If you don't have Linux yourself, you may use a linux server somewhere else, 
and log onto it from your own Windows machine. In order to do that, you need
an account on a linux machine. Getting one is not too difficult: 


* All universities have linux servers
* Various unix user fora probably offer access to their members
* You may also contact us at Giellatekno


You then need a program to log onto the linux machine. We recommend
[PuTTY](docu-putty.html).
You have to learn how to work on a Linux machine. We have
[some documentation on unix](newunix.html), and as always, the net is your friend. Your local IT experts may help with setup and unix commands.


The main difference between working locally and working via PuTTY
is that you will have no graphical tools, but must use editors
such as [emacs|docu-emacs.html]  or [nano](TheNanoEditor.html).


#  Work with the files on your own Windows machine


You will need [TortoiseSVN](docu-svn-user-tortoisesvn.html)  to access the
files.


You will need a text editor (**not** a word processor like OpenOffice
or MS Word) to edit the files. We recommend [EditPadLite](http://www.editpadlite.com).
