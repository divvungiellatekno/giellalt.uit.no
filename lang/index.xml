    <p>The Sámi language project at the University of Tromsø has worked on Northern, Lule, Southern, Enare and Skolt Sámi. Most work has gone into Northern and Lule Sámi, though, and these are also the languages included in the <a href="http://www.divvun.no">Divvun project</a>.</p>
    <p>No work has been done for Kildin Sámi. Originally, this was because our compiler tools were not able to handle the Cyrillic alphabet used to write Kildin Sámi. Now, that obstacle is gone, the other parsers use UTF-8, and all the Kildin Sámi letters are in the Unicode standard. In principle a Kildin Sámi parser may thus be made.</p>
