		<title>The common Makefile and scripts</title>
		
		<p>The Makefile is used to compile the xfst and aspell source files, i.e.
		  to make the programs. It is put to use by (being in <code>gt/</code>)
	      writing the command <code>make</code>. Makefile takes target parameter
	      from command line, that is GTLANG=&lt;lang, for example (compiling the
	      sme parser) <code>make GTLANG=sme</code>. Makefiles in general are
	      documented in introductions to the program <code>make</code>, and the
	      format of the makefiles used in this project is found in Appendix C of
	      the Beesley and Karttunen book. The makefiles for the other languages
	      follow the same layout, but they are simpler.</p>

      		<title>Makefile structure</title>
      		<p>The makefile contains variables defining tools and files to be
      		used in compiling the programs. In the beginning of makefile are
      		commonly used tools and files, and after those there are language
      		specific variables.</p>
      		
      		<p>The rest of the makefile is documented in <a href="sme/docu-sme-makefile.html">
      		sme makefile</a>.</p>

      		<p>Common scripts to all languages are in <code>gt/common/src/</code>,
      		and binaries of these scripts are in <code>gt/common/bin/</code>.</p>
