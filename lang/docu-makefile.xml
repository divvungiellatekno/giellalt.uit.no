      <h1>The common Makefile and scripts</h1>
      <p>The Makefile is used to compile the xfst and aspell source files, i.e.
         		  to make the programs. It is put to use by (being in <code>gt/</code>)
         	      writing the command <code>make</code>. Makefile takes target parameter
         	      from command line, that is GTLANG=&lt;lang, for example (compiling the
         	      sme parser) <code>make GTLANG=sme</code>. Makefiles in general are
         	      documented in introductions to the program <code>make</code>, and the
         	      format of the makefiles used in this project is found in Appendix C of
         	      the Beesley and Karttunen book. The makefiles for the other languages
         	      follow the same layout, but they are simpler.
      </p>
      <h2>Makefile structure</h2>
      <p>The makefile contains variables defining tools and files to be
         		used in compiling the programs. In the beginning of makefile are
         		commonly used tools and files, and after those there are language
         		specific variables.
      </p>
      <p>The rest of the makefile is documented in <a href="sme/docu-sme-makefile.html">
            		sme makefile</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Common scripts</h2>
      <p>Common scripts to all languages are in <code>gt/common/src/</code>,
         		and binaries of these scripts are in <code>gt/common/bin/</code>.
