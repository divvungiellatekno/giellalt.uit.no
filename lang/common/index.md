Obsolete documentation
======================

Here we keep some documentation that *now is obsolete*, but that we
don't want to throw away. Sometimes looking at how things were before
help us understand the present situation, or it may support our memory.

    infra](../sme/docu-sme-flowchart.html)
-   [The makefile setup in our old infra](../sme/docu-sme-makefile.html)
-   [Our oldinfra system for flag
    diacritics"](../sme/docu-sme-flag-diacritics.html)
