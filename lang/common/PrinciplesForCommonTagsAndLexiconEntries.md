Principles For Common Tags And Lexicon Entries
=======

This document discusses principles for common use of tags and lexical
entries across different languages.


## Lexicon entries


An overarching principle for our grammatical analysers is that lexicon entries
that are the same for different languages are upheld in one common directory,
giella-shared, and automatically added to each analyser during compilation.


This holds for the following files:

- arabic numerals
- proper nouns
- abbreviations
_ ...


The unification process is not finished.
