# Search with the search box *Simple* in Korp

Go to one of the corpus collections, e.g. [the Saami one](http://gtweb.uit.no/korp/). Press the tab **Simple** just underneath the **KORP** logo.

## The search box itself

The searchbox has one search field. Write in a wordform, and press **Search**. Note the dropdown menu to the right of the word **Search**: It is possible to save the search you have made and then use it again in comparison with other searches.

Under the search field there are 4 options:

- in order and also as
- initial part
- final part and
- case-insensitive

This gives the possibility to use simple regular expressions, e.g. "all words in *-guin*".

## Possibilities with *simple search*

### Word image

Uncheck all four alternatives, then tick **Word picture** on the right in the blue line below the search field. Enter e.g. a verb in the infinitive, and search. The search will take several minutes, but the result will be an overview of arguments linked to the verb (or two: One with an argument before and one with an argument after the verb).
