      <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>

        <p>The use of flag diacritics is documented in chapter 8 of the Xerox
        book. The present page documents the flag diacritics format, and the
        use of them in the parser.</p>

        <p>Flag diacritics are used in the Saami morphological parser in order
        to remove illegal compounds, and in order to handle
        automatic downcasing of proper names when they are converted to e.g.
        adjectives. See the documentation for each language for an overview.</p>

        <title>Flag diacritics format</title>

        <p>There are four types of flag diacritics, all of them with the
        format @operator.feature.value@ or @operator.feature@:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>U or Unification flags, @U.feature.value@</dt>

          <dd>U is the unification operator, and the form is accepted if, for
          the relevant feature, the two flags in the derivation string have
          the same value.</dd>

          <dt>P or Positive (Re)Setting, @P.feature.value@</dt>

          <dd>Sets or resets the feature to the given value.</dd>

          <dt>N or Negative (Re)Setting, @N.feature.value@</dt>

          <dd>Sets or resets the feature to the negation of the given
          value.</dd>

          <dt>R or Require Test, @R.feature.value@</dt>

          <dd>For this diacritic, a test is performed, and it succeeds iff
          feature is currently set to value, otherwise the path is
          blocked.</dd>

          <dt>D or Disallow Test, @D.feature.value@</dt>

          <dd>A test is performed that succeds if feature is neutral or set to
          a value that is incompatible with value.</dd>

          <dt>C or Clear Feature, @C.feature@</dt>

          <dd>For this flag, the value of feature is reset to neutral.</dd>

          <dt>U or Unification Test, @U.feature.value@</dt>

          <dd>If feature is currently neutra, this diacritic causes feature to
          be set to value. Else if feature is currently set, then the test
          succeeds iff value is compatible with the current value of
          feature.</dd>
