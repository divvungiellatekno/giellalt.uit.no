On the satni.org server we run the termwiki and the s√°tni databases.

__TODO:__ Write what to in case of an emergency.

!!!termwiki
termwiki depends on the services httpd, mysqld and parsoid.

Check whether the termwiki is up and running by clicking [http://gtsvn.uit.no/termwiki]

If the page does not appear, start the services needed by running these commands:
{{{
sudo service apache start
sudo service mysqld start
sudo service parsoid start
}}}
