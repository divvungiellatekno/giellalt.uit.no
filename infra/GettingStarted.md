# Getting started with the GiellaLT infrastructure

This page enables you to *build, use and develop the GiellaLT grammatical tools* yourself. Go through each of **the steps 1-2-3** below. After each step return to this page for the next step.

If you do **not** want to compile the tools yourself, but only want to **use ready-made grammatical analysers out of the box**, stop reading now and see the  [Linguistic analysis page](../ling/LinguisticAnalysis.html) instead. 

# Installing in three steps

Conduct the setup of the GiellaLT infrastructure  **in these three steps:**

## *Step 1.* Set up the computer

Set up the computer, using these instructions, for: 

- [Macintosh](GettingStartedOnTheMac.md) // [Linux](GettingStartedOnLinux.md) // [Windows](GettingStartedOnWindows.md). 


## *Step 2.* Fetch the source code
 

- [Download the core files and the language(s) you need by following these instructions](infraremake/GettingStartedWithTheNewInfra.md) 
- <small>**Skip the point following here unless you know you need it:** (People working with dictionaries and icall (mainly Troms√∏ folks) wil also need  [these *svn* files](https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/). Follow [these instructions for download](../tools/docu-svn-user.md))</small>



## *Step 3.* Compile the analysers


The page [Compiling And Using The Analysers](CompilingAndUsingTheAnalysers.md) 
tells you how to do just that. 

---

Then you are done, and can start using the analysers and/or participate in the development work.
