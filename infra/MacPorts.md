MacPorts
========

The [MacPorts Project](http://macports.org) is an open-source community
initiative to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing,
and upgrading either command-line, X11 or Aqua based open-source
software on the Mac OS X operating system

To check if MacPorts is installed, try to issue the command
`port search twig`. If this command completes without error, then you
have MacPorts.

If the above command gives an error, try to issue
`/opt/local/bin/port search twig`. If this command works, then you have
MacPorts installed. Run the [gtsetup.sh](/infra/anonymous-svn.html)
script, and quit and start your terminal programs.

If the command fails, you will have to install MacPorts. To install
MacPorts, follow these
[instructions](http://www.macports.org/install.php)
