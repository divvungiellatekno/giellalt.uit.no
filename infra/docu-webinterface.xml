      <title>The Sámi webinterface</title>
      <p>The web interface is accessed via our external pages, at <a href="http://giellatekno.uit.no" >giellatekno.uit.no</a>. The real address is 129.242.176.176, current users (June 2006) are (at least) Saara, Børre and Trond. The files are located at ../../giellatekno/.</p>
      <p>The open files are located here since the IT section does not want to maintain a web server on victorio.</p>

      <title>How the webinterface works</title>
      <p>There are two input formats: utf-8 and Latin 1.</p>
      <p/>
      <p>When the user has filled in the words to analyse, the form calls the appropriate cgi-bin script, and writes the answer out as utf-8 html</p>
