To ensure stability we have several servers:

Physical servers:
* Victorio
* xserve

Virtual servers
* gtsvn : svn goes here
* gtlab : this is for experimenting
* gtoahpa : online oahpa
* gtweb : online analysers

Admin documentation/log:
* private/admin/README-admin-gtoahpa.txt: for changes, package installation, and other things that must remain private.

General practices:
* Admin group on the four (following CentOS) are to add users to the wheel group (usermod -G wheel USER).
