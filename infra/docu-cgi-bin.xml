      <title>CGI-setup</title>

      <p>Our programs are available on the net for analyzing and generating wordforms
      and paradigms for different languages. The tools can be called from
      pages on <a
      href="http://giellatekno.uit.no/cgi">http://giellatekno.uit.no/cgi</a>.</p>

      <p>The pages are available for calling the tools in different languages. For
      the time being, the supported user interface languages are English,
      North, Lule and South Saami, Finnish, Russian and Norwegian.
      The tools are available to a varying extent for
      the approximately 30 languages found on the frontpage.</p>

      <p>The cgi-bin scripts include scripts for analysing and generating
      words and sentences in various way. The setup is divided between two systems, the
      cgi-bin and forrest documentation. For example, when adding a new
      language to the system, changes have to be made both in cgi-bin and
      forrest documentation.</p>

      <section>
        <title>CGI-scripts</title>

        <p>The relevant scripts cgi-bin scripts are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>smi.cgi<br /> Language-independent cgi-script for calling
          different language technology applications: analysis,
          disambiguation, hyphenation and paradigm generation.</li>

          <li>conf.pl<br /> Configuration file that contains most of the
          variable definitons and their initial values.</li>

          <li>LANG-num.cgi<br /> (where LANG = the languages for which there
          are numeral generators: fin, kom, mhr, nno, rus, sjd, sma, sme, smj,
          smn, sms, yrk. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>All the scripts are developed in the svn-directory, under the module
        <code>gt/scripts/cgi-scripts</code>. The official location of
        cg-scripts is on gtweb, at the cgi-bin directory under /var/www. The latest
        versions are moved to the official directory. There is a script doing
        this, <code>cgi-export</code> exporting the latest version of the
        release-tagged cgi-scripts to the directory. The user must have root
        privileges to be able to run the script. In practice, we have been
        copying the files to the official directory manually.</p>

        <p>The cgi-bin script smi.cgi is located on gtweb, at the cgi-bin
        directory. The script processes input sentences from the html scheme
        by the user, and then sends it on to the transducers sme.fst for
        analysis and isme.fst for generation. The language, charset and the
        action taken are configured by the parameters given to the script.</p>

        <p>The transducers are located at
        <code>/opt/smi/LANG/bin/</code>and<code>/opt/smi/common/bin/</code></p>

        <p>The minimum requirements for an analyzer to work is the
        file<code>lang.fst.</code></p>

        <p><a href="QuasicodeForKeepingTrackOfTransducers.html">Procedures for copying new fsts to /opt/smi is found here</a>.</p>

      <title>Forrest documentation and cgi-bin</title>

      <p>The cgi-interface is integrated with Forrest documentation and the
      pages are generated when needed. The pages are named after the language
      technology application, the language of the application and the user
      interface language. The prefixes <code>d- g- p- </code>stand for
      disambiguation (and analysis and hyphenation), generation and paradigm
      generation. For example the file d-sme.sme.html calls analysis tools for
      North Saami and the user interface is in North Sámi. The file
      p-sme.eng.html calls paradigm generation for North Sámi, the language of
      the user interface being English. Finally the file g-sme.nor.html calls
      generator for North Saami with Norwegian as the user interface
      language.</p>

      <p>The texts for different user interface languages are stored in
      XML-files in the documentation under the name:
      <code>xtdoc/gtuit/src/documentation/content/xdocs/cgi/cgi-lang.xml</code>.
      There is an xsl-script for creating the html-pages for different
      language technology applications and transferring the texts from the
      XML-files to the page. The script in question is <code>xtdoc/gtuit/src/documentation/resources/stylesheets/cgi-index.xsl</code>. The Forrest documentation does not pose a limit
      to the languages that are used for the documentation.</p>

      <p>After the cgi-script is called the user interface to the cgi is
      regenerated together with the results of the query by <code>smi.cgi</code>. The same
      XML-file that contains the texts for the user interface is used for
      generating the new html-page.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>An example: how to add new language to the documentation</title>

      <p>To add a new language, changes have to be made both in the server
      side and in forrest documentation.</p>

      <section>
        <title>Changes to cgi-bin at gtweb</title>

        <p>Compile relevant transducers and abbr.txt and copy them to the
        transducer dir</p>

        <source>mkdir -p /opt/smi/lang/bin
cp the/transducers/etcetera /opt/smi/lang/bin/
chgrp cvs /opt/smi/lang/bin/*
chmod 775 /opt/smi/lang/bin/*</source>

        <p>If you want these files to be updated automatically each day, then
        add the language code to the (now outdated) script <code>fst2opt</code>.
        Note that this script must be outdated to reflect the new server etc.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Changes to forrest documentation</title>

        <p>In order to create a new interface language: First: Please don't. We already
        have seven. Then, if you still want one: First create a page for the language,
        LANG.xml and store it
        to<code>xtdoc/gtuit/src/documentation/content/xdocs/</code>. Then add
        links to the analysis pages as shown on the other LANG.xml pages.</p>

        <p>The analysis pages are generated automatically by forrest. However, the first
        versions are quite reduced, since there are no language specific texts
        automatically available. To add text to the page, edit the different
        interface texts in the catalogue cgi, e.g. for English the file:</p>

        <source>xtdoc/gtuit/src/documentation/content/xdocs/cgi/cgi-eng.xml</source>

        <p>Note that there are seven x 2 files in the cgi catalogue, and eight
        language will then give rise to two new files.</p>

      <title>Updating the transducers</title>

      <p>Earlier, the transducers and other relevant files were updated daily using
      the <code>cron</code> facility. The script <code>gt/script/fst2opt</code> esd
      responsible for retrieving the latest version from cvs, compiling the
      binaries and copying them to the relevant directories. The crontab was
      set up by the person who is responsible of the cgi-bin setup. Due to unstable
      fsts we abandoned this system and instead went for a fully manual system.
      Now, with the number of languages rising, we want a semi-automatic system.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>The cgi-bin scripts</title>

      <p>The cgi-bin files are written in Perl and use the Perl module CGI.pm.
      The file smi.cgi is used for analysing and disambiguating as well as
      generating for different languages. It can be used for new
      languages without any additional configuration, when the tools that are
      used by the script (lang.fst etc.) are in place.</p>

      <p>The script contains a conversion from digraphs c1, s1, etc. to some
      utf-8 characters: č, š, etc. for those who don't have Saami characters in
      the keyboard. The latin-1 can be chosen as an input language as well,
      but the page that is generated is utf-8 encoded. The option is tested at
      the moment and it may turn out that it's not useful. We should consider abandoning
      this option.</p>

      <p>The files contain a very good documentation themselves (thanks to Ken
      Beesley, their original author). For info on how to maintain them, see
      available books on perl and cgi-bin.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Edit the cgi-bin files in cvs-module
        <code>gt/script/cgi-scripts</code></li>

        <li>Commit the changes to svn</li>

        <li>If the version is ready for release, tag the version with
        release-tag using command <code>cvs tag -F release filename1 filename2
        ..</code>. (this is not in use)</li>

        <li>then:
        <ol>
         <li>either execute the script <code>cgi-export</code>. The tagged files are
         exported from the cvs to the official directory. (this option is presently not in use)</li>
         <li>or (the option in use) copy the cgi-bin files manually to the var/www/smi/cgi-bin directory.</li>
         <li>In any case, make sure the www catalogue and the svn catalogue are in synch!</li>
         </ol>
        </li>

      <title>Linking due to security</title>

      <p>For security reasons, the webserver on gtweb.uit.no is run via
      symbolic links.</p>

      <p>The url to the cgi-bin scripts is:
      <code>http://sami-cgi-bin.uit.no/cgi-bin/smi/</code>, and it is now moving to
            <code>http://gtweb-bin.uit.no/cgi-bin/smi/</code></p>
