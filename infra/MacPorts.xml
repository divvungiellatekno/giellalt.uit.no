      <h1>MacPorts</h1>
      <p class="quote">The <a href="http://macports.org">MacPorts Project</a> is an open-source community initiative
         to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing, and upgrading either command-line,
         X11 or Aqua based
         open-source software on the Mac OS X operating system
      </p>
      <p>To check if MacPorts is installed, try to issue the command <code>port search twig</code>. If this command
         completes without error, then you have MacPorts.
      </p>
      <p>If the above command gives an error, try to issue <code>/opt/local/bin/port search twig</code>. If this
         command works, then you have MacPorts installed. Run the <a href="/infra/anonymous-svn.html">gtsetup.sh</a>
         script, and quit and start your terminal programs.
      </p>
      <p>If the command fails, you will have to install MacPorts. To install MacPorts, follow
         these <a href="http://www.macports.org/install.php">instructions</a></p>
