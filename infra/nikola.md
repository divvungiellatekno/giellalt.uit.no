# What is Nikola

[Nikola](http://getnikola.com) is a static site generator written in Python 3.

Our [Indigenous langtech site](http://indigenous-langtech.uit.no) uses Nikola for generating the content of that site.

## How to install Nikola

Installing Nikola makes it convenient to make new pages and posts and to have a look at the content of the site.

```
pip3 install --user Nikola
pip3 install --user "Nikola[extras]"
```

If pip3 does not exist, write
```
pip3
```
then press tab to get the minor version.

### Help! I don't have pip3
If you don't have any pip3.x version, run

```
port search pip|grep py3
```

Install the newest possible one (mine is py36-pip)
```
sudo port install py36-pip
```

Then do
```
port select --list python3
```

Again, use the highest version (mine is python36)
```
sudo port select --set python3 python36
```

You should now be ready to install nikola.

## How to use

### Getting access to the site content

To make Nikola work as `forrest run`, do
```
cd $GTHOME/xtdoc/indigenous-langtech
nikola auto
```

Open http://localhost:8000 and see the front page reveal itself in all it's glory.

### Edit the frontpage

```
open pages/index.rst
```

### Making new site pages

Make sure you are in `$GTHOME/xtdoc/indigenous-langtech`
