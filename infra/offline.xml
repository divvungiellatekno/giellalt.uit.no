      <h1>Should I work on gtlab or on my own machine?</h1>
      <p>If you have one of the project macs set up for you, you have all
         tools on your own machine, and you may as well work offline. In that
         case, you use the <a href="/tools/docu-svn-user.xml">SVN program</a>
         to get the latest versions of the files from the central computer
         gtlab, and thereafter you use the tools on your own machine, as
         described in the Tools section.
      </p>
      <p>If you do not have the Xerox tools installed on your local machine,
         you must be connected to gtlab in order to compile the program, and in
         order to use it.
      </p>
      <h2>Connecting to gtlab</h2>
      <h3>Mac users</h3>
      <p>Mac users have built-in SSH and a terminal
         application. Just open the terminal, and type <code>ssh
            username@gtlab.uit.no</code> at your prompt (where 'username' is
         your own user name at gtlab).
      </p>
      <h3>Linux users</h3>
      <p>Linux users use the same ssh command as was described for Mac OSX
         above.
      </p>
      <h3>Windows users</h3>
      <p>Windows users may e.g. use <a href="/tools/docu-putty.xml">putty.exe</a>. <strong>Remember to
            connect via ssh</strong>, not via Telnet. After we switched to Sámi
         letters internally, putty is not an ideal solution, since it for
         some reason is not able to write the letter č (all other Sámi
         letters work). (<strong>TODO</strong>: Check other terminal programs
         for Windows)
      </p>
      <p>Note that Putty is set up with an 8-bit code page as default.
         You have to change it to UTF-8, via the menu SETTINGS / ENCODING / UTF-8 /
         (finn fram ei Windowsmaskin og FIKS DENNE STIEN).
         	  
      </p>
      <h2>Reading the documentation</h2>
      <p>In order to read the documentation offline, you must have a program
         called forrest installed (se separate forrest documentation). 
      </p>
      <h2>Editing files</h2>
      <p>Do <strong>not</strong> use Microsoft Word or any other word
         processor. Word processors and text editors are two different things.
         Word processors are made to let the text look nice, text editors are
         made to edit text. In this project, we edit text. Word processors add
         secret code that makes text nice, but this code only crashes our
         programs and hampers our work.
      </p>
      <p>There is separate documentation on editors on the <a href="/tools/tools.xml">Tools page</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Downloading files</h2>
      <p>For downloading files on <strong>Windows</strong>, see the
         description on the <a href="/tools/docu-putty.xml">putty page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>For downloading files on <strong>Linux and Mac</strong>, use the
         scp procedure. On the command line on your local Linux PC, write
         (supposing your user name is trond) and you want to copy this file to
         your local machine and call it off.xml:
      </p>
      <p>scp trond@gtlab.uit.no:gt/doc/offline.xml off.xml</p>
      <p>In order to copy files to gtlab, just switch the arguments.</p>
      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      <p>What may go wrong?</p>

         <li><strong>I connect via putty or NiftyTelnet, but do not get any

               <li>Perhaps you forgot to use SSH instead of Telnet</li>
