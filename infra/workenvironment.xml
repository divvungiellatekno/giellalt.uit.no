      <title>Work environment</title>
      <p>The projects files live in a cvs repository on victorio.uit.no.
         Victorio's predecessor cochise was part of
          <a class="fork" href="http://docs.notur.no/uit">The
         High Performance Computing Program</a> at the University of Troms√∏,
         but victorio now runs our project only.
         All the lexicas, project internal scripts and documentation lives
         here.</p>

      <p>From this central, the websites and the web interfaces are built,
         and gives the <a href="http://giellatekno.uit.no">disambiguation</a>
         and <a href="http://divvun.no">spellchecking</a> websites.</p>

      <p>The most comfortable way to do development and write documentation
         is to <a href="../tools/docu-cvs-user.html">copy the files</a> from
         the cvs repository to a local computer, although it is possible to
         work directly on victorio, too.</p>

      <title>CVS Infrastructure</title>
      <p>To make CVS commit mailings work, one has to edit the file
         <code>CVSROOT/loginfo</code>. It should already be set-up correctly,
         but for the sake of documentation and understanding, it is repeated
         here:</p>

<source>
^gt          mail -s %s samicvs
^kt          mail -s %s samicvs
^st          mail -s %s samicvs
^termdb      mail -s %s samicvs
^xtdoc       mail -s %s samicvs
</source>

      <p>After that file is created/modified, we need to ensure that the
         mail alias <code>samicvs</code> is working by editing
         <code>/etc/aliases</code>. At the bottom of that file, that alias is
         defined as follows:</p>

      <source>samicvs: trond,boerre,sjur,tomi</source>

      <p>More names can and will be added when we see that it works, and all
         has been informed. When the alias is changed, or a new one created,
         one has to run
         the command <code>newaliases</code> as root or superuser. Then
         all mail to the alias samicvs will be forwarded to the local
         users listed.</p>

      <p>Finally, to forward your e-mail to your regular account, create the
         following file in your home directory: <code>.forward</code>,
         containing only the mail address of the account you want to receive
         commit mails on. Remember to add a linefeed at the end (that is, type
         return). For this forward file to work correctly, it has to have
         correct permissions, which you ensure with the following command:</p>

      <source>chmod 644 .forward</source>

      <p>That's it! Now we should all get an e-mail each time someone commits
         a file. Hint: as the amount of e-mail this generates can be quite
         high, it is advisable to create a filter in your mail application
         that will put all cvs and Bugzilla e-mails in a dedicated folder.</p>
