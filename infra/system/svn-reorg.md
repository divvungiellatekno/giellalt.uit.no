# SVN reorganisation


## Cause


We're not able to restrict access to the svn repository the way we want. We wanted to preserve the present folder structure, but restrict access to certain folders. That has turned out to be very hard.


## Solution properties


Any solution will have to isolate the folders to protect in one way or another. That is, we should move the content we want to protect to a protected area outside of the general area.


There are two types of content we need to protect:


* source code under NDA from third parties (example: some Polderland code)
* private plans and possibly unpublished articles


Two options as I see it:
* make a private folder at the root of the svn repo
* create a separate, private repository, and completely open up the present one


### Option 1
```
$SVNROOT/gt/
         xtdoc/
         private/ <== protected
         tts/somefolder <== unprotected
            /someotherfolder <== protected
         ...
```


`svn co https://gtsvn.uit.no/repos`
gives us all the open ones. To check out private parts we have to do
`svn co https://gtsvn.uit.no/repos/tts/someotherfolder`


### Option 2
```
$SVNROOTPRIVATE/plans
                polderland/
$SVNROOTPUBLIC/gt/
               tts/
```


`svn co https://gtsvn.uit.no/repos/public`
gives us the free ones.


`svn co https://gtsvn.uit.no/repos/private`
gives us:
```
plans
polderland
...
```




```
$SVNROOT/public/gt/
                xtdoc/
                st/
                ...
         /private/ <== protected
```


trond/gtsvn/public/ --> the world as we know it without the private
           /private/ --> the private, taken out of the public


an alisas for checking out both for the privileged class.


The former makes it possible to treat the whole thing as one unit
... with or without the forbidden files


The second opinion is, in a way safer. Less risk of malfunction
("oops, you got the whole lot")


```
$SVNROOT/scripts/ (here are the tools for the kal-gang and for the rest of us)
         langs/ara -> {dic, mt, fst, tts, ...}
               /bul
               /kal
               /kom
               /... --> lg
         ped/sma/
             sme/
             xxx/
         biggies
         ...
         private/
```


Pseudocode for a possible setup:
```
svn co .../repos/scripts/
cd scripts
./setup --folders=gt,tts,private, ...
```


Files relevant to all (script etc) aside, for all
big files aside 
 - then paths acc to type, and subpathsa acc to lg (possible to do only kal, but easy to do all lgs)
 - then paths acc to lang, and subpaths acc to type
private aside


two svn
ones svn with private a first-generaton mother and one sister
ones svn with private a first-generaton mother and many sisters
ones svn with private a first-generaton mother and two sisters: the default, and the big




first choole lg, then do all apps (more natural for linguists)
first choose app, the do all lgs (better struct for porting?)


(as 54, but without the public folder)


Subinterests as a grid:
acc to lg
acc to app/


procon analysis
pro a: 
uniform treatment for insiders and outsiders alike
con a:
vulnerable and difficult, conceptually complex
pro b:
clean, safe
con b:
two systems pro one (hassle for the insiders, that is)




$GTPUBLICHOME
$GTPRIVATEHOME


Use these to reference the path to each local copy.

Conclusion: we want the following three separate modules:
* biggies (subdivided - tts recordings, test reports, working corpus files, etc)
* private
* the rest (which should be of reasonable size without the biggies)


Two questions left:
* separate or shared repository => separatate
* languages or products first => both, but no lang resources in products


Concerns:
* we still need to protect older versions of the repo content, but without loosing the history of what remains.

# Migration plan


**TODO:**
# inform all users about the upcoming change
# make a copy of the svn repo, work on another machine than gtsvn
# follow the instructions in the svn book, section
  [Filtering Repository History](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.filtering)
# when everything works ok, then:
# inform all users about the upcoming change - again!
# inform all users to commit local edits
# redo the split with all the latest commits
# test that it works
# inform users about how to check out and set up their infra


* who: **Ciprian** with the help of **BÃ¸rre**
* when: the switch should be done before Easter, 8.4.2009
