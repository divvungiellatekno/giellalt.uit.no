svn setup
=========

## Requirements

The svn setup requires a few things on the server:

* apache http server - that is, a full web server, and port 80 open
* discusss the svn setup with the IT guys:
    - can we do it?
    - more external access - is that ok?
* some additional httpd plugins
* we want restricted access to some parts of the repo (basically the polderland directories, since some of the content there is under legal embargo)

Access methods:
* http://-tilgang for alle (dvs anonym) - visse katalogar blokkert - berre les

* https://-tilgang for registrerte brukarar - visse katalogar ev. blokkert for nokre brukarar, les-skriv

## Users

- from the OS (such that users in a certain group is automatically included)
- from an AuthUser list/file (to allow "random" external users write access)

Find out what httpd modules are needed to support such a setup.
