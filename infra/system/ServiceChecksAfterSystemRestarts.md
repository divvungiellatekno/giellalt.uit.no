Service Checks After System Restarts
====================================


Services to keep an eye on after system restarts - because they need to be operative all the time:

* svn-server
* sátni.org
* our web pages (and their automatic updating)
* the termwiki
* bugzilla
* iChat/Jabber
* SubEthaEdit

For each service, after a system restart you may have to do some manual work to ensure they are actually working. Please see below.

# svn-server

Nothing to do.

# sátni.org

## eXist

If the server has stopped, restart it:
cd /home/tomi/exist/
./bin/startup.sh

Check address `http://gtweb.uit.no:8080/exist/restxq/satni/dictionaries` if it returns JSON response.

If server is running, and no response is received, open eXide `http://gtweb.uit.no:8080/exist/apps/eXide/index.html` and open&save an xquery module at apps/satni/modules/

Above process helps most of the times. If it doesn't, there is most likely a bug to be solved.

## Nginx

Front-end resides on the same server as neahttadigisánit. Restarting nginx should be enough.

# our web pages (and their automatic updating)

The sites

* [http://giellatekno.uit.no]
* [http://dicts.uit.no]
* [http://oahpa.no]
* [http://divvun.no]
* [https://giellalt.uit.no]
* [http://divvun.org]

Have a look at [the info about the xserve](../xserve.html#Web+sites).

To manually update the sites, run the commands found above in the crontab entries.

# the termwiki

Have a look at [the info about gtsvn](../gtsvn.html).

# bugzilla

Bugzilla is no longer in use, we use **Issues** in git.

# iChat/Jabber

We do not use Jqabber, but **Zulip**.

# SubEthaEdit

Have a look at [the info about the xserve](../xserve.html#SubEthaEdit).
