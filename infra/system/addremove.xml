         <title>Adding users</title>
         <p>To add a new user named <em>Laila Sara</em> with <code>laila</code> as the user name, do the following:</p>
         <p>Write the following command. It shall be written in one line:</p>
         <source>sudo /usr/sbin/adduser -c "Laila Sara, Samisk inst." laila</source>
         <p>Then assign the new user a password, by writing:</p>
         <source>sudo passwd laila</source>
         <p>In order to add <code>laila</code> to another group, use this command:</p>
         <source>sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -G corpus,cvs laila</source>
         <p>Note that here, <code>laila</code> was already member of the group cvs, and we wanted to make her member of
         corpus. We still had to give all intended group memberships (except the personal group), otherwise she would
         have been kicked out of cvs.</p>
         <p>Remember to copy the <code>.bashrc, .bash_profile</code> and <code>.emacs</code> files to the laila account
         while you are still a root user. Remember to run the initial <code>svn co
         https://victorio.uit.no/langtech/trunk gtsvn</code> command, and then <code>gtsvn/gt/gtsetup.sh</code>.</p>
         <p>If the user has forgotten his/her own password, enter the command <code>sudo passwd laila</code>. You will
         not be prompted for the old password, and the new one you enters will erase the old one.</p>

         <title>Removing users</title>
         <p>For removing (in this example the user laila), be root, and use this command (<code>-r</code> removes the
         files of the user as well):</p>
         <source>sudo /usr/sbin/userdel -r laila</source>
