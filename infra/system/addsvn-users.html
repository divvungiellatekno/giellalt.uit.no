      <pre xml:space="preserve">sudo htpasswd -m /etc/subversion/svn-auth-file sally
New password: *******
Re-type new password: *******
Adding password for user sally</pre>
      <p>Add the user on the commmitters line in the file /etc/subversion/svn-authz. Relevant
         user info is found in admin in a private folder -- and should be kept.
      </p>
      <h1>Adding users to the svn mailing alias</h1>
      <p>Optionally, add the user to the alias <em>samicvs</em> in the file <code>/etc/aliases</code>, and <em>run
            the program</em> <code>newaliases</code>.
         
      </p>
      <h1>Adding new aliases for svn mail (i.e., new sets of files to send mail about to different
         users)
      </h1>
      <p>New aliases for groups of files for svn should be added to the file
         <code>/etc/aliases</code>. Thereafter, they will be used in the
         so-called post-commit hook (i.e. their svn messages will be sent to
         the members of the alias in question. Do as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Make a new alias <code>aliasname</code> for svn
            mail by adding a <em>new line</em> in the file
            /etc/aliases in this format <code>aliasname:
               your.address@uit.no, some.person@gmail.com</code>. The
            aliasname may be the relevant directory, e.g. chr
            
         </li>
         <li>Copy the last line of the post-commit script (the
            file /home/svn/langtech/hooks/post-commit), add the
            copy as a new last line of the same file, and change
            the path following <em>-m</em> to the path with the
            files you want to be covered by the alias. Change the
            address to aliasname@localhost. The resulting line
            should look like this:
            
            <ul>
               <li><code>LC_ALL=se_NO.UTF-8 commit-email.pl "$REPOS" "$REV" -m "&lt;path of interest&gt;" -h "gtsvn.uit.no"
                     -s langtech aliasname@localhost</code></li>
            </ul>
            
         </li>
         <li>The post-commit scripts are here:
            
            <ul>
               <li>/home/svn/langtech/hooks/post-commit</li>
               <li>/home/svn/biggies/hooks/post-commit</li>
               <li>/home/svn/dasago/hooks/post-commit</li>
