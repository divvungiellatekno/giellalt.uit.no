CheckInstall
============

[checkinstall](http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/) is a
program that can make packages for gtsvn and other linux machines. This
way installed programs are registered in the rpm database, and
administrators can easily install, update and uninstall these programs.
Checkinstall is used instead of `make install` to trace which files are
installed by that command

Usage/tutorial
--------------

We will use vislcg3 as an example on how to use checkinstall

1.  [Check out
    vislcg3](https://giellalt.uit.no/tools/docu-vislcg3.html#Commands+to+check+out+and+install+vislcg3),
    and replace `sudo make install` with `sudo checkinstall -R`  

2.  This appears:

        checkinstall 1.6.0, Copyright 2002 Felipe Eduardo Sanchez Diaz Duran
                This software is released under the GNU GPL.


        The package documentation directory ./doc-pak does not exist.
        Should I create a default set of package docs?  [y]:

    Press enter

3.  Next is to write a description of the program

        Please write a description for the package.
        End your description with an empty line or EOF.
        >>

    Write your description, it should contain the word *giellatekno* to
    ease the search for packages installed locally, e.g. *giellatekno
    packaging of vislcg3*. Press enter twice.

4.  The next step is to change the info for the package:

        1 -  Summary: [ giellatekno packaging of vislcg3 ]
        2 -  Name:    [ src ]
        3 -  Version: [ 20100426 ]
        4 -  Release: [ 1 ]
        5 -  License: [ GPL ]
        6 -  Group:   [ Applications/System ]
        7 -  Architecture: [ i386 ]
        8 -  Source location: [ src ]
        9 -  Alternate source location: [  ]
        10 - Requires: [  ]
        11 - Provides: [ src ]

        Enter a number to change any of them or press ENTER to continue:

5.  Enter 2, and write vislcg3

6.  Enter 3, write svn&lt;Revision number&gt;

7.  Enter 10, write libicu (which is the library that vislcg3 depends
    on)

Local changes
-------------

The file `/usr/local/lib/checkinstall/checkinstallrc` is used to
customise the behaviour of checkinstall. The line telling telling
whether packages should be installed automatically or just created has
been changed so that programs are installed immediately.
