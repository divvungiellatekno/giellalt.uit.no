Introduction
============

A new bash is required to get rid of the s√°mi characters problem when
working in the Terminal on the Mac.

Install new readline library (readline-5.0)
===========================================

First we need to install new readline library

Download
[readline-5.0](http://www.hmug.org/pub/MacOS_X/BSD/Libraries/System/readline/readline-5.0-2-osx3.tar.gz)

Move the readline directory to /tmp/ and install it.

    ssh adminis@localhost
    (asks admin password)
    mv Desktop/readline-5.0 /tmp/
    make install

Install new bash (bash-3.0)
===========================

Then, download and install new bash.

Download
[bash-3.0](http://www.hmug.org/pub/MacOS_X/BSD/Applications/Shells/bash/bash-3.0-1-osx3.tar.gz)

Move the bash directory to /tmp/ and install it.

    ssh adminis@localhost
    (asks admin password)
    mv Desktop/bash-3.0-1-osx3 /tmp/
    ./configure
    make install

To enable new bash when starting bash in Terminal.
--------------------------------------------------

    sudo mv /bin/bash /bin/bash-old
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/bash
    sudo mv /usr/share/man/man1/bash.1 /usr/share/man/man1/bash-old.1

The last command is for having manual pages for the new bash.
