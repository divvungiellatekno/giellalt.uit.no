# Status and future of Xerox and other FST tools

Presently the Giella infrastructure supports three fst technologies in parallel:
* Xerox
* Hfst
* Foma

Each of them have their strengths and weaknesses, summarised as follows:

## Xerox

**The** standard in all FST work.

Strengths:
* fast in lookup
* fast in compiling source code

Weaknesses:
* no support for weights
* closed source
* abandoned by its main developer Lauri Karttunen (he is retired, and his
  effort to open-source it was blocked by Xerox lawyers)

### Source code access

Even though the source code is not released, it is possible to get a license to
the source code of the c-fsm library
([documented here](http://web.stanford.edu/~laurik/publications/cfsm_api.pdf))
by requesting a license for the XLE page. Information and relevant links can be
found at the bottom of the
[project page](http://ling.uni-konstanz.de/pages/xle/).

## Hfst

A source-code compatible clone of the Xerox tools, based on OpenFST, but with
multiple backends (Foma, SFST, OpenFST).

Strengths:
* replicates 99% of the functionality of the Xerox tools
* is actively maintained
* is almost as fast in lookup as Xerox when using the optimised lookup format
* supports weighted fst's
* open source

Weaknesses:
* is slow in compiling fst's compared to Xerox

## Foma

A source-code and command interface compatible clone of the Xerox xfst tool,
developed and maintained by Måns Huldén. Is open source.

Strengths:
* fast in lookup
* fast in compiling source code
* actively maintained

Weaknesses:
* no support for twolc
* limited support for weighted fst's

# How to cope with this...

... ie the lack of future for Xerox, the lack of twolc in Foma and the lack of
speed in Hfst.

## Today's dual strategy

* use the fast xfst for developing and for some applications
* use the slow hfst for all applications demanding open source and/or weighting

## The future

... is dependent upon

* whether hfst will become faster
* whether foma will include support for twolc
* whether it will be possible to license some version of c-fst that will
  produce the command line tools we need

In the short run, we can continue as we do now.
