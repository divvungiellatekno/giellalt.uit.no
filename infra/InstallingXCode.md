# Mavericks / OSX 10.9 and newer

## XCode installation

Install XCode via the Mac App Store, just as for 10.7 and 10.8. See details
below.

## Command line tools

To install the command line tools, after you have installed the free XCode app,
run the following command in a terminal window:

```
sudo xcode-select --install
```

and follow the on-screen instructions.

# Lion and Mountain Lion / OSX 10.7 & 10.8

On OS Lion and Mountain Lion you must "purchase" XCode from the Mac App Store.
It is free, so no costs are involved, but it is pretty big - the download size
is 4.5 Gb.

Open the Mac App Store (*App Store* in your Dock), search for XCode, and "buy"
it by clicking the **Free** button. It will then start downloading and install
itself.

You need an Apple ID/account to download things from the Mac App Store, but no
credit card information is needed as long as you only install free apps, like
XCode.

## Command line tools

To install the command line tools that comes with XCode (and which are needed by
our infrastructure), *open XCode* (e.g. from the Launchpad). Then,  go to
*Preferences ➔ Downloads* and select the “Components” tab. There you can
choose *Command Line Tools* and click the *Install* button. This takes some
time, but then you are done.

# Older systems

XCode is availabe on the DVD that came with the computer. Please insert the DVD,
and look for instructions on how to install optional packages. Then install the
XCode package.

If you can't find the original DVD, it is also available from
[Apple](http://developer.apple.com) - registration is required but free.
