# Install XCode

Nowadays it is *not* necessary to download and install the full XCode package, it
is enough to install the command line tools - exactly the tools we are interested
in.

# Installing XCode Command line tools

To install the command line tools, after you have installed the free XCode app,
run the following command in a terminal window:

```sh
sudo xcode-select --install
```

and follow the on-screen instructions.

# Full XCode installation

If you would like to install the full XCode package for other reasons, you get
it via the
[Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/fi/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

Remember to open it after installation, and accept the license. Nothing XCode
related will work before you have done that.
