      <note>The source code is distributed partly under the GPL-license, and partly under CC-BY.
         There is a license
         statement at the beginning of each file.
      </note>
      <h1>Preparation</h1>
      <p>Anyone can download the source code via anonymous SVN. Using anonymous svn you will
         not be able to directly
         add your changes to our svn repository. If you have changes you want to be included,
         follow the guidelines
         below in the section <em>Sending feedback and patches</em>.
      </p>
      <p>To get the files, do the following: Open a terminal and use the following command
         to fetch the files:
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">svn co https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk main</pre>
      <p>The files will then be copied to your machine (you will see a row of filenames, preceeded
         by the letter
         A).
      </p>
      <p>After you have checked out, please run the following script, and follow the on-screen
         instructions:
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">main/gt/script/gtsetup.sh</pre>
      <p>With the above commands, you have now on your local computer a copy of the source
         code and the environment
         is set up properly.
      </p>
      <h1>Building, compiling and running</h1>
      <p>When everything is checked out and residing on your computer, you probably want to
         compile and run our
         linguistic analysers. For this you need to install the required tools. They are:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>For morphological analysis there are two alternatives:
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Xerox morphological transducer tools</strong>, for morphological analysis. This is
                  proprietary software, but can be downloaded from the <a href="http://fsmbook.com/">fsmbook site</a>.
                  It is also included if you <a href="http://csli-publications.stanford.edu/site/1575864347.html">buy
                     the book</a> (Finite State Morphology by <a href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/people/beesley/home.html">Kenneth R. Beesley</a> and <a href="http://www2.parc.com/istl/members/karttune/">Lauri Karttunen</a>), although the online software
                  is more up-to-date. Nevertheless, if you are serious about doing lexc, xfst or twolc
                  work, you really
                  should get that book.
               </li>
               <li>There is an open source alternative for compiling our morphological analysers, though,
                  the <a href="http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/kieliteknologia/tutkimus/hfst/index.shtml">Helsinki Finite State
                     Transducer</a>, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://hfst.sourceforge.net/">the Hfst
                     SourceForge page</a>. Our code compiles both on the Xerox and Hfst compilers, though the makefile for
                  HFST compilation is still somewhat underdeveloped. Cf. our <a href="compiling_HFST3.html">internal
                     HFST3 documentation</a>.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>For disambiguation and syntactic analysis we use <strong>vislcg3</strong>. This is open source, The <a href="http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3.html">homepage of vislcg3</a> contains documentation and link to
            Subversion acces for binary download. We have written <a href="/tools/docu-vislcg3.html">instructions on
               how to compile and and use vislcg3</a>.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other tools (perl scripts, shell scripts, etc.) are included in the SVN check-out,
         and will be available
         after you have run the <code>gtsetup.sh</code> script (see above). See our <a href="Infrastructure.html">technical documentation</a> and the subsection in the corresponding menu for
         further details.
      </p>
      <h1>Reading the documentation off-line</h1>
      <p>The full documentation is available online on <a href="http://www.divvun.no/">divvun.no</a>, but if you want
         to read the documentation off-line, you are best off installing and running <strong><a href="http://forrest.apache.org/">Forrest</a></strong>. You will find it at <a href="http://divvun.no/static_files/divvun_forrest.tar.bz2">our server</a>.
      </p>
      <p>We have made a <a href="forrest-howto.html">document</a> on how to install and use forrest, follow the
         instructions there to use forrest on your private machine
      </p>
      <h1>Sending feedback and patches</h1>
      <p>If you have improvements to our code, be it linguistic corrections, C-code bug fixes,
         documentation
         enhancements or whatever, we would welcome your contribution. Please make an <code>svn diff</code>, gzip it,
         and send it <a href="mailto:giellatekno@hum.uit.no">to us</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Interactive feedback and discussions</h2>
      <p>The whole team (and most of our active partners) is (are) available on AIM, and we
         frequently keep
         discussions through our favourite AIM client(s). Our AIM addresses can be found on
         our <a href="/admin/people.html">contact page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>We also use <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> (SEE) a lot to do
         collaborative development, but SEE is Mac only, and commercial (version 2.2 is available
         for free for
         non-commercial purposes). A cross-platform alternative is <a href="http://gobby.0x539.de/">Gobby</a> (please
         see the <a href="http://darcs.0x539.de/trac/obby/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/InstallationGuide">installation
            notes</a>, especially Mac users - the Mac version only installs through <a href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/">DarwinPorts</a>). Try it, or SEE - realtime collaborative
         development is both very fun and productive, and creates a whole new feeling of working
         together, even when
         sitting in different countries! Much of what we have done would have taken 10 x the
         time, or not been
         possible at all without SEE.
      </p>
      <p>A third alternative is to use one of the many code-sharing sites. Some of them also
         allow collaborative
         editing - not as quick and reliable as SEE, but still quite useful.
      </p>
      <p>If you have questions or problems, either e-mail us, or start a chat. Further investigation
         can be done
         collaboratively and interactively using SEE or Gobby. If you are using a Mac with
         a recent OS version (10.4.
         or newer), you can even invite us to (group) voice or video chats using <a href="http://www.apple.com/ichat/">iChat</a>. Non-group voice and video chats should also work with earlier
         versions of MacOS, as well as with a recent version of the AIM client for Windows
         (we haven't tried voice or
         video chats with Windows users).
