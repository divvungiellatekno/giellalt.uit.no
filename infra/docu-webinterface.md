The interface for our web pages.
================================

We build our web pages with [Forrest](http://forrest.apache.org), we
have 4 different forrest installations

-   [$GTHOME/xtdoc/gtuit](http://giellatekno.uit.no), the Giellatekno
    page
-   [$GTHOME/xtdoc/sd](http://divvun.no), the Divvun page
-   [$GTHOME/ped](http://oahpa.no), the Oahpa page
-   [$GTHOME/xtdoc/dicts](http://dicts.uit.no), the dictionary page

If you have set up forrest locally, you may go to the catalogues listed
above, write `forrest run`, and see the pages at
[localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/).

The actual online versions of the web pages are accessed via our
external pages, at [giellatekno.uit.no](http://giellatekno.uit.no), and
hosted on the divvun server. The site is built using the files in gtsvn
under boerre, and stored in Sites under gtuit.

The open files are located here since the IT section does not want to
maintain a web server on gtsvn.

How the webinterface works
==========================

There are two input formats: utf-8 and Latin 1.

When the user has filled in the words to analyse, the form calls the
appropriate cgi-bin script, and writes the answer out as utf-8 html
