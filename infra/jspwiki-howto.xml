    <abstract>This document will show how to write a jspwiki document. The jspwiki
      format is used to write the proceedings of the weekly meetings of the
      project group. The forrest framework then "compiles" these first to xml,
      then html.</abstract>

  </header>

  <body>
    <section>
      <title>Headers and paragraphs</title>

      <p>The jspwiki format gives the possibility to use three levels of
      headers. The first level is marked with: <code>!!!</code>, the second
      <code>!!</code> and the third is <code>!</code>. Paragraphs are made by
      placing an empty line before and after a paragraph.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Lists</title>

      <p>The jspwiki format gives the possibility to use ordered (numbered)
      and unordered lists. Both list types can have up to three levels. The
      <code>#</code> mark is used to make ordered lists, and the
      <code>*</code> mark is used to make unordered ones. <code>#, ##,
      ###</code> and <code>*, **, ***</code> gives the first, second and third
      levels for respectively ordered and unordered lists.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Miscellaneous</title>

      <p>Emphasis is made by putting <code>__</code> (two underscores) before
      and after the word one wants to emphasise.</p>
<warning>More than two underscores in a row crashes jspwiki output!</warning>

      <title>List of formatting conventions</title>

      <p>Here comes a short documentation, in tabular format.</p>

      <source>
----       = (hyphen) make a horizontal ruler. Extra '-' is ignored.
\\         = force a line break

[link]     = create a hyperlink to an internal WikiPage called 'Link'.
[this is also a link] = create a hyperlink to an internal WikiPage called
                        'ThisIsAlsoALink' but show the link as typed with spaces.
[a sample|link] = create a hyperlink to an internal WikiPage called
                    'Link', but display the text 'a sample' to the
                    user instead of 'Link'.
~NoLink    = disable link creation for the word in CamelCase.
[1]        = make a reference to a footnote numbered 1.
[#1]       = mark the footnote number 1.
[[link]    = create text '[link]'.

!heading   = small heading with text 'heading'
!!heading  = medium heading with text 'heading'
!!!heading = large heading with text 'heading'

''text''   = print 'text' in italic.
__text__   = print 'text' in bold.
{{text}}   = print 'text' in monospaced font.

* text     = make a bulleted list item with 'text'
# text     = make a numbered list item with 'text'
;term:ex   = make a definition for 'term' with the explanation 'ex'

||table  ||header
| second | row

    <section>
      <title>Caveats</title>

      <p>There is an <a href="example.html">example document</a> for
      testing that documents the features that do work.</p>

      <warning>Breaking any of the following rules will cause parsing errors and an
      error message:</warning>

      <ul>
        <li>No more than three levels of nested lists!</li>

        <li>No mixing of * and # on the same list item!</li>

        <li>Formatting constructs can't span several lines in the source
        file!</li>

        <li>Horizontal rulers (-|-[-|-) require at least one empty line on
        each side.</li>

        <li>Forced line break (\\) requires at least one printable character
        following it on the same line.</li>
      </ul>

      <note>The following mark-up won't cause syntax errors, but it doesn't parse
      as intended, and thus produces unwanted XML/HTML:</note>

      <ul>
        <li>Term lists are not parsed at all, and are rendered as the source
        text.</li>

        <li>Mixing bullet and numbered lists at different levels works, but
        will break the outer list in two, and thus restart a numbered list
        (and insert extra vertical space).</li>
      </ul>
