# Markdown formatting

# heading = large heading with text "heading"

Source:
```
# heading = large heading with text "heading"
```

Headers can't contain formatting markup - if it
does, the text from the start of the formatting and onwards will be placed in a
paragraph following the header.

## heading = medium heading with text "heading"

Source:
```
## heading = medium heading with text "heading"
```

### heading = small heading with text "heading"

Source:
```
### heading = small heading with text "heading"
```

# Links

The source for the above is:

```
[link]     = create a hyperlink to an internal WikiPage called 'Link'.
[this is also a link] = create a hyperlink to an internal WikiPage called
                        'ThisIsAlsoALink' but show the link as typed with spaces.
[a sample](link) = create a hyperlink to an internal WikiPage called
                    'Link', but display the text 'a sample' to the
                    user instead of 'Link'.
~NoLink    = disable link creation for the word in CamelCase.
[1]        = make a reference to a footnote numbered 1.
[#1]       = mark the footnote number 1.
[[link]    = create text '[link]'.
```

# Formatting

* *text*   = print "text" in italic.
* **text**   = print "text" in bold.
* `text`   = print "text" in monospaced font.

Source for the above list:
```
* *text*   = print "text" in italic.
* **text**   = print "text" in bold.
* `text`   = print "text" in monospaced font.
```

Here's a horizontal ruler:

----

And it's source:
```

----

```

Horizontal rulers require an empty line on each side.\\Otherwise one will get a
syntax/parsing error.

The previous paragraph contained a forced line break. The source looks like the
following:

```
Horizontal rulers require an empty line on each side.\\Otherwise one will get a
syntax/parsing error.
```

Forced line breaks require at least one printing character following it on the
same line (i.e. it can't be the last thing on the line, and just a space after it
isn't enough), otherwise one will get a parsing error.

# Lists

Lists can be nested up to three levels:

* 1 - text     = make a bulleted list item with *1 - text*
* 2 - first level, second item
    - 2.1 - next level, first item
    - 2.2 - next level - use the numbering to track the level and item nesting
    - 2.3 - test
    - 2.4 - test
* 3 - test
* 4 - test
    - 4.1 - test
    - 4.2 - test
        - 4.2.1 - third and final level, first item
        - 4.2.2 - test
        - 4.2.3 - test
        - 4.2.4 - test
    - 4.3 - test
* 5 - test

The source code for the bulleted list:

```
* 1 - text     = make a bulleted list item with *1 - text*
* 2 - first level, second item
    - 2.1 - next level, first item
    - 2.2 - next level - use the numbering to track the level and item nesting
    - 2.3 - test
    - 2.4 - test
* 3 - test
* 4 - test
    - 4.1 - test
    - 4.2 - test
        - 4.2.1 - third and final level, first item
        - 4.2.2 - test
        - 4.2.3 - test
        - 4.2.4 - test
    - 4.3 - test
* 5 - test
```

The same goes for numbered lists:
1. 1 - text     = make a numbered list item with *1 - text*
1. 2 - first level, second item
    1. 2.1 - next level, first item
    1. 2.2 - next level - use the numbering to track the level and item nesting
    1. 2.3 - test
    1. 2.4 - test
1. 3 - test
1. 4 - test
    1. 4.1 - test
    1. 4.2 - test
        1. 4.2.1 - third and final level, first item
        1. 4.2.2 - test
        1. 4.2.3 - test
        1. 4.2.4 - test
    1. 4.3 - test
1. 5 - test

Source:
```
1. 1 - text     = make a numbered list item with *1 - text*
1. 2 - first level, second item
    1. 2.1 - next level, first item
    1. 2.2 - next level - use the numbering to track the level and item nesting
    1. 2.3 - test
    1. 2.4 - test
1. 3 - test
1. 4 - test
    1. 4.1 - test
    1. 4.2 - test
        1. 4.2.1 - third and final level, first item
        1. 4.2.2 - test
        1. 4.2.3 - test
        1. 4.2.4 - test
    1. 4.3 - test
1. 5 - test
```

It is **NOT** possible to mix numbered and bulleted lists.

Definition lists do not work:

* **term**: ex   = make a definition for *term* with the explanation *ex*

Source:
```
* **term**: ex   = make a definition for *term* with the explanation *ex*
```

# Tables

The following code:

```
|   table | header
| --- | ---
|   normal | cell
```

gives this table:

|   table | header
| --- | ---
|   normal | cell
