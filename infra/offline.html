Should I work on gtlab or on my own machine?
============================================

If you have one of the project macs set up for you, you have all tools
on your own machine, and you may as well work offline. In that case, you
use the [SVN program](/tools/docu-svn-user.xml) to get the latest
versions of the files from the central computer gtlab, and thereafter
you use the tools on your own machine, as described in the Tools
section.

If you do not have the Xerox tools installed on your local machine, you
must be connected to gtlab in order to compile the program, and in order
to use it.

Connecting to gtlab
-------------------

### Mac users

Mac users have built-in SSH and a terminal application. Just open the
terminal, and type `ssh             username@gtlab.uit.no` at your
prompt (where 'username' is your own user name at gtlab).

### Linux users

Linux users use the same ssh command as was described for Mac OSX above.

### Windows users

Windows users may e.g. use [putty.exe](/tools/docu-putty.xml).
**Remember to connect via ssh**, not via Telnet. After we switched to
Sámi letters internally, putty is not an ideal solution, since it for
some reason is not able to write the letter č (all other Sámi letters
work). (**TODO**: Check other terminal programs for Windows)

Note that Putty is set up with an 8-bit code page as default. You have
to change it to UTF-8, via the menu SETTINGS / ENCODING / UTF-8 / (finn
fram ei Windowsmaskin og FIKS DENNE STIEN).

Reading the documentation
-------------------------

In order to read the documentation offline, you must have a program
called forrest installed (se separate forrest documentation).

Editing files
-------------

Do **not** use Microsoft Word or any other word processor. Word
processors and text editors are two different things. Word processors
are made to let the text look nice, text editors are made to edit text.
In this project, we edit text. Word processors add secret code that
makes text nice, but this code only crashes our programs and hampers our
work.

There is separate documentation on editors on the [Tools
page](/tools/tools.xml).

Downloading files
-----------------

For downloading files on **Windows**, see the description on the [putty
page](/tools/docu-putty.xml).

For downloading files on **Linux and Mac**, use the scp procedure. On
the command line on your local Linux PC, write (supposing your user name
is trond) and you want to copy this file to your local machine and call
it off.xml:

scp trond@gtlab.uit.no:gt/doc/offline.xml off.xml

In order to copy files to gtlab, just switch the arguments.

Troubleshooting
---------------

What may go wrong?

-   **I connect via putty or NiftyTelnet, but do not get any "username"
    prompt:**  
    1.  There may be a firewall active. Contact your system
        administrator
    2.  Perhaps you forgot to use SSH instead of Telnet
    3.  Perhaps you are not on the internet
-   **More trouble..?:**
