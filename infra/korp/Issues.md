- Regex with and without period


## Regex with and without period

There are two issues:

1. In *Extended*, if picking  morphosyntactic feature from the **â“˜** symbol, the symbol ``\.`` is added. ``.`` is enough
2. We need a different system for final tags, all cases, all Px tags, Inf, ...*. These are not (necessarily) followed by a period, byt they may be.
