      <p>All our projects are run in UTF-8, and have been so since the spring of 2005.</p>

      <section>
        <title>North Saami</title>

        <p>In our web interface there is a filter to let users feed in c1, d1, s1, etc,
         instead of the correct Saami letters. Output to the user is in UTF-8.</p>

      <section>
        <title>Lule Saami </title>

        <p>There is a script,
        <code>spell-relax.regex</code>, so that the descriptive analyser understands <code>ñ</code> and
        <code>ń</code> for <code> ŋ</code>.</p>

      <section>
        <title>South Saami</title>

        <p>The script 
        <code>spell-relax.regex</code> is used for South Saami as well, but 
        with a slightly different purpose: It is used to accept the wide-spread
        sloppy use of <em>i</em> for <em>ï</em>.</p>

	<title>Our other languages</title>
	<p>Languages with Cyrillic have their source code in Cyrillic. Languages with both
	Latin and Syllabic script (such as Plains Cree) have source code in Latin with
	conversion transducers to and fro Syllabic.</p>

        <p>Note especially that for Iñupiaq, we do <em>not</em> use the wide-spread 8-bit
        <em>Interactive IñupiaQ Dictionary</em> encoding, as it has placed the Iñupiaq
        characters in the ASCII area. There is a converter on the Iñupiaq page.</p>
