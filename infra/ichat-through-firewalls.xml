            <title>Howto iChat through firewalls</title>
            
            <p>While Mac's iChat (from 10.8 onwards iMessage) group text chats work from inside certain fire walls, audio and video group chats don't always work. To make them work, their trafic has to go through a proxy. This document describes how to set this up on Mac OS X, using SquidMan.
