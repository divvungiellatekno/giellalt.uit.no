      <h1>Test of the language technology documentation</h1>
      <note>This report is obsolete, and may be deleted</note>
      <p>
         I have started to navigate through the documentation and look for problems. My testing
         was done mainly in the period 05.02.2007 - 17.02.2007
         
      </p>
      <h1>Front pages</h1>
      <h2>The Giellateknologiija project web-side</h2>
      <p>
         I started on this page to look for information about anonymous cvs. I did not find
         anything and I did not get the impression that I needed to search in another web site.
         I then had to ask the technician Børre who told me that I had to go to the Divvun
         site (Sametinget) to find the information. It would be a good thing if there were
         tips in the text on the language technology front page that you can find useful tools
         via the Divvun site and also in Risten. It is not enough to have just the links, you
         should also be introduced and told how to navigate.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         Another problem on this (university) side: After having chosen English language, I
         could not go back to Saami language.
         
      </p>
      <h2>The Divvun project web-side</h2>
      <p>
         I started to look for the tools for linguistics analysis on the front page. The information
         that it is possible to try out the tools could be more explicit. For instance, under
         the existing heading "Source code and documentation" there could be added that you
         need the code in order to get access to programs or tools. A tip should also be added
         in the text on the front page that it is possibly to go to Risten and to the (universitys)
         giellateknologiija sites and use the tools found there (for instance the Sametinget
         protocols corpus). The point is that you should be told on the front page where you,
         firstly, find the tools that are ready to use and, secondly, where to find the CVS
         tools (that are not that user friendly!). In other words there should be an introduction
         on the first page.
         
      </p>
      <h1>Checking out using anonymous cvs</h1>
      <p>
         At first I started the testes with the computer I use in my daily work with the language
         technology project. This computer of course already has got the tools and files installed.
         I managed to log in via anonymous CVS on the computer and I managed to check out (copy
         the source and documentation). The only problem with this was that there were a lot
         of cvs checkout and updating amongst the file names. This may not be a problem though.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         I then started to work on my private computer (Macbook) and tried to do the same thing
         here. This will be more realistic and the rest of the testing were done on this private
         computer. The instruction on the Divvun site told me how to log in to the cvs server.
         This went well.
         
      </p>
      <h1>Installing transducer, perl etc</h1>
      <p>
         Then I went on to read the instructions on how to build, compile and run linguistics
         analysis. The instruction on our web side "Anonymous CVS" said (in chapter 4. "Building,
         compiling and running") that you need two tools first: Xerox morphological transducer
         tools and vislcg. When I went to the web site where the transducer should be, I had
         problems finding the transducer under downloads there. I now had to ask a technician
         ( Børre) to help. He told me that you have to buy a certain book in order to get the
         transducer. This should of course be stressed in the instructions. I have not tested
         more on how to install the transducer, as our technician now has fixed it for me.
         The download for VISL I did find and I downloaded it. There was however one difficulty.
         The instruction in our Divvun page said that I had to compile (the vislcg) myself,
         using a GCC 2.9x compiler (or update the source code to compile with newer versions
         of GCC:-). I did not however find more instructions on how to precede with this, and
         I am not sure if the vislcg works after my instalment.
         
      </p>
      <h1>Where is the corpus and where do you find out where to start</h1>
      <p>
         I now wanted to download the corpus and use the disambiguator. But I was not sure
         where I could find the instructions for this. It should maybe have been under the
         info about anonymous cvs? I had problems finding it. I am not sure if there even exist
         instructions, but if so, then there should be added a link to them. At least I found
         a link to basic user documentation, which led me to "How to use the CG-2 parser vislcg".
         When I went there I discovered there a link called "Tools" that contains amongst other
         things "lookup" and "how to analyze". Maybe this was the disambiguator? I was not
         sure whether any of these links contains info on how to download the corpus. I went
         back to CVS site and now discovered a link to "technical documentation". Maybe I now
         had found all the links I needed? It would however be nice if the front page or the
         "anonymous csv" page could have a short text about where and what sort of corpus there
         is and where the links to the tools are and in what order one could look at the links.
         THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY LINKS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START. I
         have now looked at the instruction in all the relevant links, but I have not found
         anything on how to get started when you have an anonymous cvs.  I later learned that
         one probably can start on the page "How to use the Saami parsers" There seems to be
         no information about restricted and open corpus. There needs to be a short introduction
         on how to get started with the corpus. This information should certainly be on the
         page "Anonymous CVS" under chapter 4 "Building, compiling and running". In this chapter
         should also be a suggestion where to start, for instance there could be a link to
         "How to use the morphological parser."  PS: the word "corpus" is indeed mentioned
         under the side "How to use the Saami morphological parsers", but it is not explained
         what it is.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         While waiting for the needed update in the instructions I guessed that a good place
         to start would be the side "How to use the Saami morphological parsers". I found out
         that this at least can do morphological analyses. The instructions told me to log
         in, but this seems to be somewhat misleading, as I already have used the anonymous
         CVS the previous day.  I have later heard that you log in only if you want to work
         in the restricted part of Victorio. The instructions should mention this, and also
         tell exactly how to log in (or contain links to the page that explains this) I tried
         now without login in, and I managed to update the files. The commands for compiling
         (in chapter 1 and 2.1) were old but this problem has now been fixed, the documentation
         is updated, but please look if chapter 1 is OK, when I last looked it still said that
         you should write "make" in src, this is maybe wrong.  My compilation was however aborted
         because I lacked something called perl. When I wanted to analyse one word at a time,
         I could not use "sme/bin/sme.fst". The reason seems to be perl lacking. I could however
         use "sme/bin/sme.save", but this opportunity was not mentioned in the instructions
         as far as I know. I now had a serious problem. The technicians had to install perl
         and Develop tools before I could go on. I have so far tried only the Northern lookup.
         I also tested 2.2. "generating words" and 2.3."Analysing more than one word at a time".
         Under this last heading is even Victorio mentioned, but nothing about what it is 
         and how to get there. I then I went on to chapter 3. "Analysing files." (Under the
         side "how to use the morphological parser".) This is maybe the open corpus? The instructions
         told me to give a filename, so I guessed that I could analyse one of my own documents.
         The information about this opportunity and the instructions are lacking. The instruction
         must tell how to put usual documents in. I tried, but I did not know that it had to
         be a txt-document. Trond Trosterud had to help me. The instructions must also contain
         information about the open corpus and how to get password to the closed corpus. I
         have now heard from informed peoples that the main corpus is in Victorio. The instructions
         should certainly have a link to it.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         When I continued using "How to use the Saami morphological parser" the next day, I
         found out that I this time would try to check out only existing files. Without first
         logging in I wrote only "cvs up". The machine then asked for my victorio-password.
         This is not mentioned neither under the side "Anonymous CVS" nor under "How to use
         the Saami morphological parser". The reason is probably that I confused the info about
         password and the info about anonymous CVS.
         
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">Connection closed by 129.242.4.42
cvs [update aborted]: end of file from server (consult above messages if any)</pre>
      <p>
         I did not understand this message. I tried again and this time it worked.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The instruction under "Setting up the environment" then told me to change to gt/sme/src
         and then write "make". This did not seem to work, and this may still be old instruction
         (the last time I checked). The result was:
         
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">Type 'quit' to exit.

Bye!
make: *** No rule to make target `closed-sme-lex.txt', needed by `../bin/sme.save'.  Stop.</pre>
      <p>
         I then went to "Analysing one word at a time" where you are told to be in gt to do
         compiling. This worked fine as it did the previous day.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         I now went on to "Analysing files" (as I did not manage this the previous day).I now
         managed to analyse my own documents as well as the main corpus in Victorio. Here should
         however be a link to Trond Trosteruds course "Unix for lingvistar" where you find
         more useful commands for analysis.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         However when I tried to use the corpus as anonymous CVS and wrote (when in gt): <code>ccat -1 sme -r zcorp/bound | preprocess --abbr=bin/abbr.txt | lookup -flags mbTT bin/sme.fst
            | grep '+N+Pl'</code>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         the message was:
         
      </p>
      <p>
         ERROR in ‘LOOKUP’: <code>Lexicon file 'bin/sme.fst' could not be found or opened</code>
         
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">-bash: ccat: command not found
Cant open the file: No such file or directory</pre>
      <p>
         I think I tried this in the wrong catalogue. When I tried the same in sme, the message
         was:
         
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">-bash: ccat: command not found</pre>
      <p>
         The instructions under both "Anonymous CVS" and "How to use the Saami morphological
         parsers" must tell if there are restrictions.
         
      </p>
      <h1>The interactive programs and texts on internet</h1>
      <p>
         I have also tested these (in Saami giellateknologiija page) and reported to Trond
         Trosterud.
         
      </p>
      <h1>Conclusions and final comments</h1>
      <p>
         I have tested what I believe is most important if you want to do analysis, namely
         the front pages in Divvun and the disambiguating projects, the pages "Anonymous CVS"
         and " How to use the Saami morphological parsers". I have also tested the interactive
         programs and text on Saami giellateknologiija page. The test was mainly done in the
         period 05.02.2007 - 17.02.2007. Some of the problems have already been fixed.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         As mentioned I saw a problem on the front pages, namely that a short introduction
         on how to navigate was lacking. You also should be pointed to the interactive tools
         on the Internet that everyone can use, as well as to the CVS opportunity. The point
         is that you should be told about both, so you don't risk that you start working with
         only CVS without knowing about the other tools, and vice versa. It should also be
         more explicitly said why you need a source code.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The instalment of the transducer and the VISL was not easy for me. If you want the
         transducer you have to buy a certain book. I also had a problem with something called
         perl. This was lacking, and I could not do any analyses before the technicians installed
         this and the develop tools. These things are crucial. Maybe the reason for my problems
         with perl was that I had not installed or compiled the VISL properly??
         
      </p>
      <p>
         The information on how to find the corpus and where to start was not good. The page
         "Anonymous CVS" should in chapter 4 (Building, compiling and running) contain a link
         to the page "How to use the Saami morphological parsers". This page last mentioned
         I believe is the best starting point after having read "Anonymous CVS". The page "How
         to use the Saami morphological parsers" did not mention how to get a password and
         it lacked links or information about how to log in. You should be told that some parts
         of the corpus are restricted. There should be short explanations about the corpus.
         The explanations about how to use your own files for analysis were not sufficient
         good. It would also be useful if there under chapter 3 "Analysing files" was a link
         to Trond Trosteruds linux-course, because the commands are very relevant here. I discovered
         some old commands about compiling. This is now fixed, but please look if chapter 1
         (“setting up the environment ")  is OK, when I last looked it still said that you
         should write "make" in src, this is maybe wrong. " The page "Anonymous CVS" did not
         tell you what to do if you just want to update and then suddenly are asked for your
         Victorio-password. Shall you then use the anonymous CVS again? This error however
         I believe occurred because I confused the info about password and the info about anonymous
         CVS. This page should also explain shortly that you may want to get a password and
         how. There was no info about how to apply for access.
         
      </p>
      <p>
         I have not tested everything in the documentation but I have now managed to use the
         most important tools in spite of the lack of instructions. I have reported problems
         to Børre and I will follow this up and come back with a second report later. I will
         also continue to try out some details in the instructions and include comments about
         them in the next report.
