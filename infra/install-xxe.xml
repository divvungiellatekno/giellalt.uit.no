      <title>Installing XXE</title>

      <p>Fetch XXE at <a
      href="http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/download.shtml">XMLminds download
      site</a>. Choose the autoinstalling versions for Mac OS X, and follow
      the instructions, which are basically drag-n-drop into the the "Program"
      folder.</p>

      <title>Installing support for forrest</title>

      <p>Run XXE, this will make a directory $HOME/.xxe4</p>

      <p>Then, download the forrest support <a
      href="http://divvun.no/static_files/XXE_forrest_config-1.4.zip">package</a>.
      You will have a folder called forrest on your desktop after this. Move
      this folder to the correct place using this command in Terminal:
      <code>mv $HOME/Desktop/forrest $HOME/.xxe4/addon/.</code>. Press enter.
      XMLEditor will now have support for the forrest document format, and the
      next time you open a forrest document those documents will be shown
      using the installed stylesheets.</p>
