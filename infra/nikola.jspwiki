!!!What is Nikola

[Nikola|http://getnikola.com] is a static site generator written in Python 3.

Our [Indigenous langtech site|http://indigenous-langtech.uit.no] uses Nikola for generating the content of that site.

!!How to install Nikola

Installing Nikola makes it convenient to make new pages and posts and to have a look at the content of the site.

{{{
pip3 install --user Nikola
pip3 install --user "Nikola[extras]"
}}}

If pip3 does not exist, write
{{{
pip3
}}}
then press tab to get the minor version.

!Help! I don't have pip3
If you don't have any pip3.x version, run

{{{
port search pip|grep py3
}}}

Install the newest possible one (mine is py36-pip)
{{{
sudo port install py36-pip
}}}

Then do
{{{
port select --list python3
}}}

Again, use the highest version (mine is python36)
{{{
sudo port select --set python3 python36
}}}

You should now be ready to install nikola.
