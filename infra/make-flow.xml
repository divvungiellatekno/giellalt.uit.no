      <title>Transducer compilation - how the makefile is structured</title>
   </header>
   <body>
      <p>This is a document that tries to first describe the present situation as of december 2010, and then lay out
      what we want to have in the not too distant future.</p>
      <section>
         <title>The present transducer compilation flow</title>
         <p>A number of default targets are defined for all languages. The list is language depended, ie defined for
         every language we presently support. The language is specified using the variable $TARGET.</p>
         <p>The following describes how it is done using the Xerox tools (the HFST compilation is still too
         underdeveloped to really be comparable).</p>
         <ol>
            <li>compile all LexC source files (in $SRCS) to a lexical transducer using lexc. The resulting transducer
            should have paths of the following form:<source>gieseme#ruevtie+CmpN/SgN+CmpN/SgG+CmpN/PlG+N+Der1+Der/Dim+N+Sg+Ill+PxSg2:gieseme#ruevt%^aLATUS%Â»tje%&gt;assedh</source>(corresponding
            to the surface word form <em>giesemeruavtatjassedh</em>)</li>
            <li></li>

      <section>
         <title>The future transducer compilation flow</title>
         <p>A number of default targets are defined for all languages. The list is mainly language independed, but
         possibly with language extension. The variable used to specify the language should be renamed to $GTLANG.</p>
         <p>The following describes how it is done using the Xerox tools (the HFST compilation is still too
         underdeveloped to really be comparable).</p>
         <ol>
            <li>compile all LexC source files (in $SRCS) to a lexical transducer</li>
            <li>fork the lexical transducer processing in two:<ol>
                  <li>regular processing</li>
                  <li>further processing for hyphenation purposes</li>
               </ol></li>
