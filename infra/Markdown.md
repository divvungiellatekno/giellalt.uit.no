How to write documentation in Markdown
=============

Moving to Github implies moving from *jspwiki* to *markdown*. Old jspwiki pages will be converted to markdown, pages written in the *giellalt.github.io* repository should be written in markdown directly. 

# The best advice: Use a markdown editor

* [The MacDown editor for macOS](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) (we recommend this one)
* [A list of other markdown editors](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/markdown-editors)

Using an editor will let you see what the page looks like before checking it in.
