This site contains the technical documentation of the GiellaLT
infrastructure, developed and used by Divvun and Giellatekno.
It is an open source website providing analysers and tools for
[a wide range of languages](/lang//index.html), as well as
[a ready-made setup](infraremake/HowToAddANewLanguage.html) for adding more languages.

## The possibility to make computer tools for your language

Computer tools supported by our infrastructure include:

* linguistic analysers (morphology, syntax)
* spell checkers and grammar checkers
* morphologically enabeled e-dicionaries
* machine translation

## ... by using the following linguistic technology

We write our morphology as [finite state transducers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_state_transducer)
in the formalisms *lexc* and *twolc*, and compile it into computer programs for language analysis with the compilers xfst ([http://fsmbook.com]) and
hfst ([http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/kieliteknologia/tutkimus/hfst/]).
Our syntax we write in [constraint grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_grammar),
and we compile our files with vislcg3 ([http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3.html]).
The installation of these compilers are docummentet on the [Getting Started](GettingStarted.html) page.

## Licensing and cooperation
