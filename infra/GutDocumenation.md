# Gut documentation

`gut` is a tool to do multirepo maintenance of `git` repos hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/). It handles:

* adding and removing users
* cloning, cleaning, fetching, pulling, pushing, branching and removing repos
* switch between private and public
* creating teams
* set info, topics and webhooks, including programmatically using scripts
* update many similar repos based on a delta from a template repo (fast and easy distribution of new features)
* helper commands to set up CI for targeted repos
* repo names can be matched using regular expressions
* run any other git command (or any other command) by way of applying a shell script to targeted repos
