# Installing Linux On Windows

This page is a short version of [this longer introduction](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/). It explains how to get the Linux command line on Windows 10.

1. Open **Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows Features On Or Off**.
1. Turn **Windows subsystem for Linux** on. (If you do not have this option, your Windows 10 is too old, and you should  update it to [the October 2018 update](https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-download-and-install-the-windows-10-fall-creators-update-right-now))
1. Restart the computer
1. Go to the Start Menu and chose **Microsoft Store**. Search for **Linux**, and under the **Linux on Windows?** banner, click **get the apps**.
1. Chose the Linux version you want. We recommend Ubuntu.

After this is install, you have access to the Linux command line on your Windows machine.
