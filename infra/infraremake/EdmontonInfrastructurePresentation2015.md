# Overview of the presentation

* background and goals
* bird's eye view
* closer view of selected parts:
    - documentation
    - testing
    - from source to final tool

# Background and goals

* Background
* Goals

## Background

* need for simpler maintenance
* scalability, both for languages, tools and linguists and other developers
* developing NLP resources is a lot of work, and languages are complex - we need
  a tool and an infrastructure to handle the complexity in a managable way
* keep technical details out of the way
* make the daily work as simple as possible
* division of labour
* Recognition: know the basic setup of one language - know the setup of them all

## Goals

* easy support for many languages
* easy support for many tools
* keep language independent and language specific code apart
* easily upgradable
* the resources in our infrastructure should live on for decades or more

## General principles

1. Be explicit (use *non-cryptic* catalogue and file names)
1. Be clear (files should be found in non-surprising locations)
1. Be consistent (identical conventions in all languages as far as possible)
1. Be modular
1. Divide language-dependent and language-independent code
1. Reuse resources
1. Build all tools for all languages
1. ... but only as much as you want (parametrised build process)

# Bird's Eye View and Down

* the house
* organisation - directory structure
* technologies (xerox, hfst, foma + cg)
* templated build structure and source files
* configuration of builds

## The House

## The House and the Infra

[../images/hus_eng_2015_with_infra.png]

* `*Machine translation: fst's built by the infra, the rest handled by Apertium`
* `*Speech synthesis is not (yet) built by the infra, conversion to IPA is part of the infrastructure though`
* `Supported: fst's and syntactic parsers used are built by the infrastructure`

## $GTHOME - directory structure

Some less relevant dirs removed for clarity:

## Technologies

* All technologies are rule-based as opposed to statistical and similar
  technologies.
* This allows us to write grammars that are precise descriptions of the
  languages - reference grammars in a way
* Goal: The documentation for your grammar - with suitable examples etc -
  could be the next published grammar for your language (we'll return to that
  shortly)

### Technology for morphological analysis

We presently use three different technologies:
* Xerox - closed source, not properly maintained, fast, no weights
* Hfst - open source, actively maintained, used in our proofing tools
* Foma - Open source, actively maintained, fast (newly added, not available
  for all fst's yet)

### Technology for syntactic parsing

* Cg (VISLCG3, from University of Southern Denmark)
* used for syntactic parsing
* also for grammar checking
* Basic idea: remove unwanted readings or select wanted ones based on the
  morphosyntactic context (= output of the morphological analysis)
* Example:

```
1. We like finite verbs:
SELECT:Vfin VFIN ;
```

## Templated Build Structure And Source Files

* Common resources in `$GTHOME/core/`
* Template for new languages, including build instructions
* The template is merged (using svn merge) with each language when updated

## Configurable builds

We support a lot of different tools and targets, but in most cases one only
wants a handful of them. When running `./configure`, you get a summary of the
things that are turned on and off at the end:

```
$ ./configure --with-hfst
[...]

  -- Xerox is default on, the others off unless they are the only one present --

  * build HFST fst's: yes
  * build Foma fst's: no

  -- basic packages (on by default): --

## The build - schematic

[../images/new_infra_build_overview.png]

# Closer View Of Selected Parts:

*Documentation
*Testing
*From Source To Final Tool:
**Relation Between Lexicon, Build And Speller

# Closer View: Documentation

* Background
* Implementation

## Background
* Documentation is always out-of-date
* It tends to be much more out-of-date when heavily separated from the thing to
  be documented, and vice versa
* How to improve: make it possible to write documentation within the source code
* This is similar to JavaDoc, Doxygen and many other such system
* Ultimate goal:
    - Document the source code so that it can be published as the next reference
   grammar!

## Implementation
* The infrastructure will automatically extract comments of a certain type, and
  convert them into html
* One can cite portions of the source code, as well as test data.
* The syntax of the comments must follow the jspwiki syntax

Example cases:
* [https://giellalt.uit.no/lang/fin/root-morphology.html]
* [https://giellalt.uit.no/lang/smj/nouns-affixes.html]

Documentation:
* [https://giellalt.uit.no/infra/infraremake/In-sourceDocumentation.html]

# Closer View: Testing

* testing framework
* yaml tests
* in-source tests
* other tests

## Testing Framework

All automated testing done within the infrastructure is based on the testing
facilities provided by Autotools.

All tests are run with a single command:

```
make check
```

Autotools gives a `PASS` or `FAIL` on each test as it finishes:

[../images/make_check_output.png]

## Yaml Tests

These are the most used tests, and are named after the syntax of the test files.
The core syntax is:

* a header
* test sets:
    - test name
    - test data
* syntax requirements: indents using spaces, multiple choices as lists within
  brackets, colons after everything except the word forms

```
Config:
  hfst:
    Gen: ../../../src/generator-gt-norm.hfst
    Morph: ../../../src/analyser-gt-norm.hfst
  xerox:
    Gen: ../../../src/generator-gt-norm.xfst
    Morph: ../../../src/analyser-gt-norm.xfst
    App: lookup

Tests:
  Noun - mihkw - ok : # -m inanimate noun, blood, Wolvengrey
     mihko+N+IN+Sg: mihko
     mihko+N+IN+Sg+Px1Sg: nimihkom
     mihko+N+IN+Sg+Px2Sg: kimihkom
     mihko+N+IN+Sg+Px1Pl: nimihkominân
     mihko+N+IN+Sg+Px12Pl: kimihkominaw
     mihko+N+IN+Sg+Px2Pl: kimihkomiwâw
     mihko+N+IN+Sg+Px3Sg: omihkom
     mihko+N+IN+Sg+Px3Pl: omihkomiwâw
     mihko+N+IN+Sg+Px4Pl: omihkomiyiw
```

### Yaml test output

[../images/make_check_output.png]

* each yaml test file has its own line of output with PASS / FAIL /TOTAL
* at the end of each yaml test run (= all yaml files for the same fst) there
  is a summary of the total results for that yaml test run
* ... followed by the Automake PASS / FAIL message

## In-Source Tests

* LexC tests
* Twolc tests

### LexC tests

As an alternative to the yaml tests, one can specify similar test data within
the source files:

```
LEXICON MUORRA !!= @CODE@ Standard even stems with cg (note Q1). OBS: Nouns with invisible 3>2 cg (as bus'sa) go to this lexicon.
 +N:   MUORRAInfl ;
 +N:%> MUORRACmp  ;

## €gt-norm: kárta # Even-syllable test
## € kártta:         kártta+N+Sg+Nom
## € kártajn:        kártta+N+Sg+Com
```

Such tests are very useful to serve as checks for whether an inflectional
lexicon behaves as it should.

The syntax is slightly different from the yaml files:
* word form first
* multiple alternative word forms on separate lines

### Twolc tests

The twolc tests look like the following:

```
## € iemed9#
## € iemet#

## € gål'leX7tj#
## € gål0lå0sj#
```

The point is to ensure that the rules behave as they should.

## Other Tests

You can write any test you want, using your favourite programming language.
There are a number of shell scripts to test speller functionality, and more
tests will be added as the infrastructre develops.

# Closer View: From Source To Final Tool:

* Relation Between Lexicon, Build And Speller
* Fst's And Dictionaries

## Relation Between Lexicon, Build And Speller

* tag conventions
* automatically generated filters
* spellers and different writing system / alternative orthographies

### Tag Conventions

We use certain tag conventions in the infrastructure:

* `+Err/...` (`+Err/Orth`, `+Err/Cmp`)
* `+Sem/...`
* and more...

### Automatically Generated Filters

* Many of these clusters of tags are used for specific purposes, and are removed
  from other fst's.
* tag using a common prefix (like `+Err/` or `+Sem/` gets filters for
  different purposes automatically
* there are filers for:
    - removing the tags themselves
    - remvoing strings / words containing the tags
* by adhering to these conventions, you get a lot of functionality for free
* this system is used when...

### Dealing with descriptive vs normative grammars

* the normative is a subset of the descriptive
* tag the non-normative forms using `+Err/...` tags
* write your grammar as descriptive
* remove the `+Err/...` strings
* => normative fst!

# Summary

* scalability
* division of labour
* language independence
* ... but still flexible wrt the needs of each language

# Giitu

* Thank you!
