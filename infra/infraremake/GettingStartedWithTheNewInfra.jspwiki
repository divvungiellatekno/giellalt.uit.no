!!!Installation and setup

The required steps for setting up the computer and installing the
auxiliary programs needed are described in our
[Getting Started guide|../GettingStarted.html].

!!!Check out the source code


If you only do linguistic analysis for a limited number of languages you will
do fine by only checking out the core modules, and then each language
separately. It will save you a lot of download time and disk space.


!!Check out the core modules

There are two required core modules:
; giella-core: core scripts and technical data required for the build system
; giella-shared: resources shared among all languages or language groups

To check out the core modules and prepare them, open a terminal window.
Then make a separate folder for giella language technology. Call it 
e.g. {{giella}} or {{main}} or whatever you want. Then go into the folder 
(we here assume you called it ''giella'' and check out the two core
modules:

{{{
mkdir giella # only once
cd giella
svn co https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/giella-core
svn co https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/giella-shared
cd giella-core
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
cd ../giella-shared
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
}}}

To make the core modules accessible, add the following line to your {{.profile}} or
{{.bashrc}} file (found in your home directory):

{{{
export GIELLA_CORE=$HOME/giella/giella-core/dir
export GIELLA_SHARED=$HOME/giella/giella-shared/dir
}}}

We here assumed that you made a folder {{giella}} in your home directory, 
if you used another name or placed the folder somewhere else you should adjust the 
paths in the above commands accordingly.  Then 	open a new terminal window. Now you are done.

''If you do this on a server'': For each module, after you did {{make}} above, do: 
''sudo make install''.

That is it. __NB!__ This method requires that you redo the installation every
time the core modules are updated, although should not happen too often.

!!Check out the languages you want

Then, for each language you want to work with, make a language folder next to the 
{{giella-core}} and {{giella-shared}} modules, and check out the language(s) you want
(the --username option is not needed unless you want to contribute with your work. 
See below if you do), by giving these commands:

{{{
cd $HOME/giella # or wherever you put it
mkdir langs # only once
cd langs
svn co https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/langs/LANGCODE --username <your_username>
}}}

where {{LANGCODE}} is the ISO 639-3 three-letter code for the language. You
can see a list of the languages we currently have by looking at our
[langs|https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/langs/], [startup-langs|https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/startup-langs/] and [experiument-langs|https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/experiment-langs/]Â folders. The language behind the codes you find on the __Find a language__ box on [this page|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3] (or see [this list|../../lang/index.html]).

When you have checked out the language(s) you want to work with, then you
are ready to ''actually getting started with your language''.



!!!Getting started with your language

When you have installed and checked out qw explained above, do the following:

{{{
cd $HOME/giella/fin
./autogen.sh -l
./configure
}}}

(replace __fin__, the code for Finnish, with the language(s) you checked out). Now
you are ready to start working. More info about where to find the different
pieces of source code can be found on [this page|NewinfraCatalogues.html].

__NOTE__ that the command {{./configure}} assume that you checked out the 
__Xerox compilers__ (see the Getting s

To build the transducers and other tools for linguistic analysis, do:

{{{make}}}

To run the preinstalled tests, do:

{{{make check}}}



__WARNING__

You may encounter troubles with your CLASSPATH. We are working on it, 
here is a fix if the compiler complains it is not set:
In the langs directory, write {{export CLASSPATH=}}.

Happy linguistic coding!
