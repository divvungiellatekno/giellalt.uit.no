!!!Installation and setup

The required steps are described in our
[Getting Started guide|../GettingStarted.html]

!!!Check out the source code

!!Everything

If you are working with many languages, or with both linguistic analysis and
e.g. language learning (Oahpa) or dictionaries, you want to check out
everything. That process is documented
[on a separate page|../../tools/docu-svn-user.html#The+first+commands].

!!Only the GT core and the wanted language(s)

If you only do linguistic analysis for a limited number of languages you will
do fine by only checking out the core modules, and then each language
separately. It will save you a lot of download time and disk space.

It can be wise to create a separate directory for holding the core and
language modules. The command to do this is (with the name of the directory
set to "langtech"): {{mkdir langtech}}. Then {{cd langtech}} and continue.

There are two required core modules:
; giella-core: core scripts and technical data required for the build system
; giella-shared: resources shared among all languages or language groups

!!Check out the core modules

To check out the core modules and prepare them, do this:

{{{
svn co https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/giella-core
svn co https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/giella-shared
cd giella-core
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
cd ../giella-shared
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
}}}

To make the core modules accessible, there are two methods: one intended for
single users, and one intended for multiuser servers (but it works fine for
single users as well).

__EITHER:__ The first method uses environmental variables, one called
GIELLA_CORE and the other GIELLA_SHARED.
They must be manually set. Add the following line to your {{.profile}} file:

{{{
export GIELLA_CORE=/path/to/your/giella-core/dir
export GIELLA_SHARED=/path/to/your/giella-shared/dir
}}}

Replace {{/path/to/your/giella-core/dir}} with the real path on your system, and
the same for {{/path/to/your/giella-shared/dir}}. You can
get them by using the command {{pwd}} after you did the {{./configure}} command
above. Then open a new terminal window. Now you are done.

__OR:__ The server method is to install some of the components of the core modules. For each module, after you did {{make}} above, do:

{{{
sudo make install
}}}

That is it. __NB!__ This method requires that you redo the installation every
time the core modules are updated, although should not happen too often.

!!Check out the languages you want

Then, for each language you want to work with, do the following:

{{{
svn co https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/langs/LANGCODE --username <your_username>
}}}

where {{LANGCODE}} is the ISO 639-3 three-letter code for the language. You
can see a list of the languages we currently have by looking at
[https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/langs/].

When you have checked out the language(s) you want to work with, then you
are ready to...

!!!Actually getting started with your language

When everything is installed and checked out, then do the following:

{{{
cd $GTLANG
./autogen.sh -l
./configure
}}}

where $GTLANG is the directory name of the language you want to work with. Now
you are ready to start working. More info about where to find the different
pieces of source code can be found on [this page|NewinfraCatalogues.html].

To build the transducers and other tools for linguistic analysis, egdo:

{{{make}}}

To run the preinstalled tests, do:

{{{make check}}}

__WARNING__

You may encounter troubles with your CLASSPATH. We are working on it, 
here is a fix if the compiler complains it is not set:
In the langs directory, write {{export CLASSPATH=}}.

Happy linguistic coding!
