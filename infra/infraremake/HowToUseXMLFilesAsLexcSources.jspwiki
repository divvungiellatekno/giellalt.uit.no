There are a couple of points, described in further details below:

* the files are checked against a schema
* as long as the files follow this schema, just dropping them in the dir
  {{src/morphology/stems/}} is enough - they will then be automatically
  converted to lexc, and from there on to the lexical fst as usual.

The xml format has so far only been used by the AKU project. Further use may
require some adaption or generalisations of the present structure.
