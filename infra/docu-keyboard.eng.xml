        <title>Keyboard layouts on the computer</title>
  <p>For all modern operative systems (Linux, Mac, Windows) there are ready
      installed keyboard layouts for North Saami, and in some cases also other
      Saami languages. See the language and keyboard settings on your computer.</p>
<p>If you do not find the language or keyboard layout you want, you may also
    use the keyboards Divvun and Giellatekno have made for
      <a href="http://divvun.no/keyboards/desktopindex.html">the Saami languages</a> and for
<a href="https://giellalt.uit.no/keyboards/kbdlangdocs/LanguageSpecificKeyboardDocumentation.html">some other languages</a>.</p>
