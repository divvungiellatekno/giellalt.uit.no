# Getting started with the GiellaLT infrastructure on a server

This page is a part of the overall [Getting started](GettingStarted.html) documentation.
It describes the final steps before you can start developing for your language
when you are on a multiuser server. It is assumed the server
[has been prepared by a system administrator](SettingUpAMultiuserServer.html)
to contain everything you need to get going.

For each language you want to work on, follow [these instructions](SetUpTheFiles.html).

Further useful commands in the daily work can be found on [this page](/tools/docu-svn-user.html#Frequently+used+commands).
