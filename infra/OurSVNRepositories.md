# Our svn repositories

The Giellalt *linguistic code* (language models, keyboards) is on [git](http://github.com/giellalt). We are successively moving files to git, but there are still 4 svn repositories:


* **langtech** - our main source code repository, with dictionaries, documentation and e-learning. We are currently migrating documentation files (like this one) to git.
* **biggies** - large datasets like spell checker test results, recordings and test corpora
* **freecorpus** - freely available corpus files (the non-free corpus data is available for research and development purposes upon request, and with a signed user agreement); corpus files are organised according to format, converted quality and purpose, then according to language, and then genre
* **speech** - speech language technology data, presently speech synthesis recordings and accompanying text files
