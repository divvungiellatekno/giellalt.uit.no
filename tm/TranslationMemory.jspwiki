We use parallel texts from our corpora both in Korp (SIKOR) and for translation memories.
The parallel files are made in the corpus repositories (see
[the Corpus documentation|../ling/ParallelCorpusConversion.html] for info on how to make them).

!!! Translation memories

We also bundle all parallel files together and put them in a folder called {{omegat}}
([https://victorio.uit.no/biggies/trunk/mt/omegat/]). We store the translation memories
into the {{tm}} subfolder of each of the language pairs in the {{omegat}} folder.
The collections are in the so-called tmx format. For easy access we have listed them below
(control-click (right-click) on the tmx file you want and download it).

* [North Saami - Inari Saami|https://victorio.uit.no/biggies/trunk/mt/omegat/sme-smn/tm/]

The translation memory files may then be used in programs like the following:

* [OmegaT|omegat.eng.html] 
* [Autshumato|autshumato.html]
* [Trados|https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trados] (commercial software)
* ... and many others.

The folders under {{mt/omegat}} are built so that they may be downloaded and used
as a project folder for OmegaT.
