# Where can I find documentation for what?

The documentation is organised as follows:

- language specific documentation is organised in separate subdomains, links to each language can be found as follows:
    - [keyboards and locales](keyboards/KeyboardLayouts.md)
    - [morphology, syntax, text processing, proofing tools](LanguageModels.md)
    - [speech technology resources](SpeechTechnologyResources.md)
- general technical & language independent documentation: [this site](/index.md)
- Documentation specific to Divvun, Giellatekno and Troms√∏:
    - [old site](https://giellalt.uit.no)
    - [new site](https://divvungiellatekno.github.io/giellalt.uit.no/) (will be moved to the old site URL when it is fully converted)
