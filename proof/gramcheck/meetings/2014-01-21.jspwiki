Notes from a work meeting with Fran and Sjur

* list bugs we found, priorities for the work (on the wiki page)
** bugs: no disambiguation, unrec. word disappears in cg output, blue underline on wrong word (due to no disamb), gramcheck crashing on *any* data outside the expected xml in {{errors.xml}}
* work on 2.0 of the zhfst specification
* fst-based preprocessor
** punctuation as a separate loop or separate fst before and after
* run disambiguation cg using cg3_sentence_copy
