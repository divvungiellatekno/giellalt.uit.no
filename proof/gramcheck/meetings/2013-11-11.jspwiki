# Grammar checker meeting

Nov. 11, 2013, Fran & Sjur

* Sjur to test that the code in gramchk compiles

Pending things:

* Stabilise the layout of the data. What we have works, do we need any more files ?
    - a bit early, we need to experiment more with the actual features we need
    - at least we need a normative generator for the suggestions, possibly with dialect tags
* Should we use a zip file, or just a flat directory layout. What should be the file names ?
    - zip file for ease of distribution
    - directly read the zip file as for the speller
    - suffix: .zgram
    - use an index file as for the speller

* Try and develop the error.xml file a bit more: 
    - Add translations
    - Check if it is sufficient

* Tokenisation
    - move the sentence splitting code from voikko core to language code
    - do sentence splitting in CG, for language-dependent capitalisation errors and sentence boundary definitions
    - also word-level tokenisation would need to be moved to the language code, preferably by the lookup tool
        - either: extract list of punctuation from fst - Fran if lexc doesn't work out
        - or: encode optional punctuation in LexC - Sjur

* Code note: sentence/Sentence.cpp

* Suggestions.

Some existing tools and resources:
* [http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/lightproof-editor]
* [http://libreoffice.hu/2011/12/08/grammar-checking-in-libreoffice/]
* [http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/five-apps/five-libreoffice-extensions-to-help-you-catch-grammar-problems/]

* On/off interface for individual error checks
    - talk to Harri about this -- probably wants to do the same for Finnish
    - grouping errors into code - type
    - perhaps use the settings dialog box for the extension to manage this.

Integration plan:
* LibreOffice (OpenOffice?)
* MacOSX grammar/speller API
* MS Office - probably through a VB or .Net wrapper (true Office integration is blocked)

Try to lobby MS to allow grammar checkers etc for Greenlandic, SÃ¡mi (and others?)
