%Method:Other NN grammar checkers
%Evaluation of the rule-based grammar checker on the evaluation corpus
%and then run the yaml tests 
%which corpus should we use for evaluation? it should be pre-annotated
%reproducability: links for versions of the grammar checker, scripts
%technical background - # Chiara, Tommi, Mika
%% Scripts / pipelines / technologies (FST, CG, infra)  # Tommi, Chiara
Gramdivvun #Linda
%% Describe the NN model # Mika
% describe the problematic issue of constructing a "reliable" error corpus
% do newspapers have reliable grammar/spelling - no, but how should we measure the quality of that
% time effort - rule-based vs. NN - maybe make a flowchart # Chiara
%we need the evaluation results soon, so that Linda can do a qualitative evaluation
%make a nice title
%talk about future work in this article: more error types
%the bottle neck for NN is the manual error mark-up
%Mika to Tromsø
