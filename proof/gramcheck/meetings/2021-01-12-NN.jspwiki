* the first thing to do is split the data
* gtfree.bash: take the corpus and convert it and put it in2 files 
* the same happens with the boundcorpus with gtbund.bash
* next is text2chars.py: ensure that words are aligned, and adds space in between characters
* data_generator.py: original version to split compounds from Mika
* compoundsplitgt.py: same as Mika version but works with our corpus
* Der/... Sem/... Ex/... Gram/...

TODO: 
* making these script output json
* pos analysis
* Chiara checks BÃ¸rre's pipeline to make sure we can use that one and then take POS from there
* Deadline for applying to Sigma2: 22.02.2021.
