Extended proofing tools
=======================

This document is meant as sketch for ideas on making an extended proofing tool, containing as many ways of helping the writer as possible. Target audiences ar both  L2 and L2 speakers as well as dyslectic writers.

## Proofing suggestions immediately

Today, we get a red line when we write an error. In order to get a suggestion, we have to ask for it. A possibility would be to present the suggestion menu as soon as we press SPACE (and remove it if we continue writing).

In order to avoid using the mouse, we may also
