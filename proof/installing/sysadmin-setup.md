Installing spellers on machines with a separate admin account
====================


Institutions often distribute **Windows computers** to their employees with a separate **admin** account with a separate password (often unknown to the user).

In order to install proofing tools on such machines, do the following:

1. Track down the person with the administrator password
2. Be sure to **close the Divvun Manager** if you have it running, in the following way:
	1. Close Divvun Mananger by locating its miniature symbol on the task line (there is a box showing several programs if you click on the **^** symbol to the low right of the task bar). If the Divvun Manager symbol is not found in this pop-up box you are fine and can proceed)
	2. Right-click the symbol and close the program 
3. Locate the Divvun manager (e.g. via the Microsoft menu)
4. Right-click on the Divvun Manager symbol and **run it as administrator**
5. Install the languages you want. The program starts out by offering Saami languages, if you want other languages select the *Divvun languages* dropdown menu on the top and choose "All repositories".

After chosing your language(s), press the **Install** button and follow the instructions. Check it by opening e.g. Microsoft Word and look for the green AB symbol next to the name of your language.


Other tools on the [divvun.no](http://divvun.no) page that must be installed will have to be installed in the same way. Web-based tools (like e.g. the grammar checkers) may be used without admin password.

**A note of warning:**

Not only *installing* but also *using* the Divvun Manager requires system administrator password. Thus, make sure to decide what language(s) to install and check that everything works while you have access to the admin password.
