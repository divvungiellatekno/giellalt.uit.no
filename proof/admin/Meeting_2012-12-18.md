# Speller meeting

What is needed for a new release:
* a working installer
* working plx conversion

# Installer

There's [a separate document](WindowsInstallationTest.html) containing the test results for different combinations of MS Office and Windows  versions.

**DONE:**
* **Børre** has done further studies in the registry entry diffs.
    - compare commits 66858 and and 67001 - in both cases the last addition causes the spellers to be registered (but not working) - for **all** Sámi languages.

**TODO:**
* look at combinations of Windows XP and Office (**Børre**)
* get a proper MS certificate, to remove the warning users get when installing (**Børre**)

**POSTPONED:**
* find an outsourcing option (**Børre, Sjur**)
* next week: try updating NSIS ourselves (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - using Tino's documentation & old docu's from PLX
* send a request to an NSIS developer e-mail list (**Sjur**)
* try to find an NSIS script for building MSI packages (**Børre**)
* add Windows 8 support to our installer (if possible)

# PLX conversion

Nothing new since last meeting 14.12. Tomi has made a new speller, but the test results were identical to the previous version.

Remaining PLX bugs:

## Second PRI

|   Strange PLX behaviour
| --- 
| Mihkalmas-beaivi | 593

Thomas has added some more test words to try to help find the issue with this bug. The result seems to be consistent: a lexicalised noun that is just a hyphen away from a dynamic compound, will block that dynamic compound. Thomas will add even more, and more different test words to try to confirm if this behaviour is consistent over more classes of compounds.

Here is the test result:

|  Mihkalmas-beaivi	| (253) Mihkalmasbeaivi | Missing words in beta 2 WONT FIX IN PLX
|  Omma-goahti		| (253) Ommagoahti      | Missing words in beta 2
|  Pieski-lávvu		| (253) Pieskilávvu, (251) Pieskilávu, (249) Pieskilávvo, (247) Pieskilávo | Missing words in beta 2
|  Gaup-áiti			| (253) Gaupáiti        | Missing words in beta 2
|  Moshagen-buvda	| (253) Moshagenbuvda   | Missing words in beta 2

We conclude that it is ok to block dynamic hyphen compounds when we have lexicalised non-hyphen variants. It could be considered a feature. The fact that it seems to behave consistently indicates that we can leave it as it is. A nice, undocumented PLX feature :)

**DONE:**
* **Tomi** has solved even more PLX bugs

**TODO:**
* investigate the inconsistent PLX conversion bug, cf *guollibusse* (**Tomi**)
* solve the remaining PLX bugs one by one (**Tomi**)

# Release plan

The December 1 goal has passed, without meeting the targets. On the plus side is that the number of open PLX bugs have been greatly reduced, and Tomi are squashinhg PLX bugs all the time. It just takes more time than anticipated.

The installer was not easily solved by the WiX alternative - it turned out that the Greenlandic proofing tools installer has the same problems as we have.

Re-scheduling the release plan:

* New deadline December 20:
    - PLX bugs solved
    - if met, we'll release a 2.3 update using the NSIS installer, and mainly linguistic improvements for SME
* January 4: new Windows installer Alpha
* January 10: Beta release, PLX fixes for SMA and SMJ
* January 21: Divvun 3 release
