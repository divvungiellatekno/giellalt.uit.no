!!!Speller meeting

What is needed for a new release:
* a working installer
* working plx conversion

!!!Installer

Tino has mailed us about his latest finding: his WiX installer works if the user has never opened MS Office before, but after the first invocation of any Office application, it doesn't work anymore using HKLM. Instead the tools must be registered for each user. He is working on a solution.

__DONE:__

__TODO:__
* test Tino's analysis of the installer problem (__Børre__)
* look at combinations of Windows XP and Office (__Børre__)
* get a proper MS certificate, to remove the warning users get when installing (__Børre__)

__POSTPONED:__
* find an outsourcing option (__Børre, Sjur__)
* next week: try updating NSIS ourselves (__Børre, Sjur__)
** using Tino's documentation & old docu's from PLX
* send a request to an NSIS developer e-mail list (__Sjur__)
* try to find an NSIS script for building MSI packages (__Børre__)
* add Windows 8 support to our installer (if possible)

Remaining PLX bugs:

The ''Sámi radio'' case: convert all elements to independent {{WIX}} (for acceptance), keep the whole - including the space - as an {{WI}} (for suggestions).
