# Speller meeting

What is needed for a new release:
* a working installer
* working plx conversion

# Installer

There's [a separate document](WindowsInstallationTest.html) containing the test results for different combinations of MS Office and Windows  versions.

**DONE:**
* **Børre** has done further studies in the registry entry diffs.
    - Adding Speller in the following string causes the spellers to be registered (but not working) - for **all** Sámi languages.

```
Z'KpbtLFg=q~u8wq9[\[]6fSpeller>o?4P8a4R~=zb`Eohjn9!
```

**TODO:**
* look at combinations of Windows XP and Office (**Børre**)
* get a proper MS certificate, to remove the warning users get when installing (**Børre**)

**POSTPONED:**
* find an outsourcing option (**Børre, Sjur**)
* next week: try updating NSIS ourselves (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - using Tino's documentation & old docu's from PLX
* send a request to an NSIS developer e-mail list (**Sjur**)
* try to find an NSIS script for building MSI packages (**Børre**)
* add Windows 8 support to our installer (if possible)

# PLX conversion

Nothing new since last meeting 14.12. Tomi has made a new speller, but the test results were identical to the previous version.

Remaining PLX bugs:

BUT: Tomi has only worked with nouns, not adjectives. IF all the regressions involve adjectives, then the regressions are fine, since we then need to apply the noun changes also to the adjectives. BUT if the regressions also involve nouns, then it is a more serious problem.

**TODO - ALT.1:**
* revert to the Monday morning state, when we only had the two first regressions above
* compile (test speller) and check that we are back at the Monday morning state
* dig through the meeting memos to find the date when the two regressions on Monday were introduced
* check the diffs for that speller PLX conversion, to see if there are ways to correct the regressions
* release (possibly with the two regressions we had Monday morning) before Xmas

**TODO - ALT.2:**
* build on the work done the last days
* fix the regressions - there are quite a few of them
* no release before Xmas

## Second Last PRI

Bugs from here on can be left out of the next release if we are short on time.

**DONE:**
* **Tomi** has solved even more PLX bugs

**TODO:**
* investigate the inconsistent PLX conversion bug, cf *guollibusse* (**Tomi**)
* solve the remaining PLX bugs one by one (**Tomi**)

# Release plan

The December 1 goal has passed, without meeting the targets. On the plus side is that the number of open PLX bugs have been greatly reduced, and Tomi are squashinhg PLX bugs all the time. It just takes more time than anticipated.

The installer was not easily solved by the WiX alternative - it turned out that the Greenlandic proofing tools installer has the same problems as we have.

Re-scheduling the release plan:

* New deadline December 20:
    - PLX bugs solved
    - if met, we'll release a 2.3 update using the NSIS installer, and mainly linguistic improvements for SME
* January 4: new Windows installer Alpha
* January 10: Beta release, PLX fixes for SMA and SMJ
* January 21: Divvun 3 release
