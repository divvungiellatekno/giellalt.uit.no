# Speller meeting

Release planning

What is needed for a new release:
* a working installer
* working plx conversion

# Installer

Decisions:
* stick with NSIS
* build MSI packages
* look for outsourcing possibilities (see NSIS home page)

## Outsourcing possibilities

[http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Support] - there is a dead link to a commercial
support page. Even though it is dead, somebody added it, which means that they
somehow intend to provide commercial support.

Contact e-mails to NSIS developers: [http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Contact]

**DONE:**
* follow up on Tino (**Sjur**)

**TODO:**
* find an outsourcing option (**Børre, Sjur**)
* write to NSIS contacts (**Børre, Sjur**)
* follow-up on Tino for more info about greenlandic, future options (**Sjur**)

# PLX conversion

Hyphen issue in PLX conversion.

```
%- -> 0 | _ .#. ;
```

**DONE:**
* hopefully solved the double hyphen constructions & suggestions

**TODO:**
* add a rewrite rule to remove string-final hyphens for RCmpnd words (**Tomi**)

# Release plan

Meeting every afternoon, solving one issue at a time until we have a release
candidate.
