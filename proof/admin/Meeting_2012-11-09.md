# Speller meeting

Release planning

What is needed for a new release:
* a working installer
* working plx conversion

# Installer

Decisions:
* stick with NSIS
* build MSI packages
* look for outsourcing possibilities (see NSIS home page)

## Outsourcing possibilities

We got more info from Tino, quite helpful. No answer from the NSIS people yet.

**Sjur** also brought up some future possibilities with Tino regarding switching
away from PLX to HFST-based solutions. There are many open questions regarding
that still.

**DONE:**
* follow-up on Tino for more info about greenlandic, future options (**Sjur**)
* write to NSIS contacts (**Børre, Sjur**)

**TODO:**
* find an outsourcing option (**Børre, Sjur**)
* next week: try updating NSIS ourselves (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - using Tino's documentation & old docu's from PLX

# PLX conversion

Hyphen issue in PLX conversion. Fixed:
```
set flag-is-epsilon ON
%- -> 0 | _ .#. ;
```

Tomi is testing the speller with the recent changes. When testing is done, a new
speller will be built.

**DONE:**
* add a rewrite rule to remove string-final hyphens for RCmpnd words (**Tomi**)
    - solved problems with shortened/vowel-reduced compounds (for example
   `goahte` was with hyphen)

**TODO:**
* next week: sit down and look thoroughly at the remaining PLX issues
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Thomas**)

# Release plan

Meeting every afternoon, solving one issue at a time until we have a release
candidate.
