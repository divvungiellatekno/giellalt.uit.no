# Speller meeting

What is needed for a new release:
* a working installer
* working plx conversion

# Installer

**DONE:**
* find e-mail address for UiT/IT staff that has helped us earlier, send e-mail

**TODO:**
* test MSI package, esp. with admin install and different Win/Office combos
  (**UiT/IT, Sjur**)

**POSTPONED:**
* find an outsourcing option (**Børre, Sjur**)
* next week: try updating NSIS ourselves (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - using Tino's documentation & old docu's from PLX
* send a request to an NSIS developer e-mail list (**Sjur**)
* try to find an NSIS script for building MSI packages (**Børre**)
* add Windows 8 support to our installer (if possible)

# PLX conversion

The latest PLX file is substantially smaller than earlier, only 6,5 Gb vs 25+ Gb earlier.
The change has happened during the last day or two.

One ommission - that can't explain the reduced size - is that particles like *almma, bat, ges, han* have been lost in the latest spellers.

Remaining PLX bugs:
