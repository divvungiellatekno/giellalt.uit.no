# Speller meeting

What is needed for a new release:
* a working installer
* working plx conversion

# Installer

There's [a separate document](WindowsInstallationTest.html) containing the test results for different combinations of MS Office and Windows  versions.

**DONE:**
* write to Tino about the issues with his installer, link to installer test table (**Sjur**)
* **Børre** has analysed the diffs and the registry entries involved in the installer; more analysis required

**TODO:**
* study the diffs, especially the NOB proofing tool diff (**Børre**)
* look at combinations of Windows XP and Office (**Børre**)
* get a proper MS certificate, to remove the warning users get when installing (**Børre**)

**POSTPONED:**
* find an outsourcing option (**Børre, Sjur**)
* next week: try updating NSIS ourselves (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - using Tino's documentation & old docu's from PLX
* send a request to an NSIS developer e-mail list (**Sjur**)
* try to find an NSIS script for building MSI packages (**Børre**)
* add Windows 8 support to our installer (if possible)

**DONE:**
* **Tomi** has solved even more PLX bugs

**TODO:**
* investigate the inconsistent PLX conversion bug, cf *guollibusse* (**Tomi**)
* solve the remaining PLX bugs one by one (**Tomi**)

# Release plan

The December 1 goal has passed, without meeting the targets. On the plus side is that the number of open PLX bugs have been greatly reduced, and Tomi are squashinhg PLX bugs all the time. It just takes more time than anticipated.

The installer was not easily solved by the WiX alternative - it turned out that the Greenlandic proofing tools installer has the same problems as we have.

Re-scheduling the release plan:

* New deadline December 20:
    - PLX bugs solved
    - if met, we'll release a 2.3 update using the NSIS installer, and mainly linguistic improvements for SME
* January 4: new Windows installer Alpha
* January 10: Beta release, PLX fixes for SMA and SMJ
* January 21: Divvun 3 release
