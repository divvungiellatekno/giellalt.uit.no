!!!Speller meeting

What is needed for a new release:
* a working installer
* working plx conversion

!!!Installer

There's [a separate document|WindowsInstallationTest.html] containing the test results for different combinations of MS Office and Windows  versions.

__DONE:__
* __Børre__ has done further studies in the registry entry diffs.

__TODO:__
* look at combinations of Windows XP and Office (__Børre__)
* get a proper MS certificate, to remove the warning users get when installing (__Børre__)

__POSTPONED:__
* find an outsourcing option (__Børre, Sjur__)
* next week: try updating NSIS ourselves (__Børre, Sjur__)
** using Tino's documentation & old docu's from PLX
* send a request to an NSIS developer e-mail list (__Sjur__)
* try to find an NSIS script for building MSI packages (__Børre__)
* add Windows 8 support to our installer (if possible)

!!!PLX conversion

Remaining PLX bugs:

!!Second PRI

WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE FOLLOWING:

|| Strange PLX behaviour
|Mihkalmas-beaivi | 593

It seems that the lexical entry ''Mihkalmasbeaivi'' __blocks__ the dynamic compound ''Mihkalmas-beaivi''. This suggest a strange bug in the PLX code somewhere, but we don't know where and how - yet. Needs to be investigated.

Thomas will add some more test words to try to help find the issue with this bug.

!!Second Last PRI

Bugs from here on can be left out of the next release if we are short on time.

__DONE:__
* __Tomi__ has solved even more PLX bugs

__TODO:__
* investigate the inconsistent PLX conversion bug, cf ''guollibusse'' (__Tomi__)
* solve the remaining PLX bugs one by one (__Tomi__)

!!!Release plan

The December 1 goal has passed, without meeting the targets. On the plus side is that the number of open PLX bugs have been greatly reduced, and Tomi are squashinhg PLX bugs all the time. It just takes more time than anticipated.

The installer was not easily solved by the WiX alternative - it turned out that the Greenlandic proofing tools installer has the same problems as we have.

Re-scheduling the release plan:

* New deadline December 20:
** PLX bugs solved
** if met, we'll release a 2.3 update using the NSIS installer, and mainly linguistic improvements for SME
* January 4: new Windows installer Alpha
* January 10: Beta release, PLX fixes for SMA and SMJ
* January 21: Divvun 3 release
