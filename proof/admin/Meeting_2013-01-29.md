# Speller meeting

What is needed for a new release:
* a working installer
* working plx conversion

# Installer

Tino has mailed us about his latest finding: his WiX installer works if the user has never opened MS Office before, but after the first invocation of any Office application, it doesn't work anymore using HKLM. Instead the tools must be registered for each user. He is working on a solution.

**DONE:**

**TODO:**
* test Tino's analysis of the installer problem (**Børre**)
* look at combinations of Windows XP and Office (**Børre**)
* get a proper MS certificate, to remove the warning users get when installing (**Børre**)

**POSTPONED:**
* find an outsourcing option (**Børre, Sjur**)
* next week: try updating NSIS ourselves (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - using Tino's documentation & old docu's from PLX
* send a request to an NSIS developer e-mail list (**Sjur**)
* try to find an NSIS script for building MSI packages (**Børre**)
* add Windows 8 support to our installer (if possible)

Remaining PLX bugs:

## Second PRI

The new regression can be easily fixed by blocking nums from all other positions than first.

## Second Last PRI

Bugs from here on can be left out of the next release if we are short on time.

**DONE:**
* **Tomi** has solved almost all PLX bugs
    - fix Anár, even if it means that Sirpmá-skuvla is back
    - block numbers from all compounds except when first (BI)
    - fix sámedikkepresideanta, even if it makes other regressions (they are less important)
    - fix gčhan
* build a new speller with the remaining bug fixes
* test against gold standard corpus (**Tomi** did)

**TODO:**
* solve the remaining PLX bugs: (**Tomi**)
