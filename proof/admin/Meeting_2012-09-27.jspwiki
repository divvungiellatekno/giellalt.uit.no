!!!Speller meeting

Status:

* the size of the generated PLX file has been reduced from ~60 GB to 23 GB after we turned off the -vuohta derivation and Thomas had lexicalised the most frequent derivations.
* the reduction in size seems to have fixed the PLX compilation issues - the latest speller behaves identical to the test speller for the test cases we have (which did display the size-related inconsistencies earlier).
* There are some hyphen compound issues in the latest speller

This is GREAT news :) - we might actually have a stable and predictable speller compilation setup again!

Next steps:

* fix the remaining PLX conversion bugs using the speller test bench (__Tomi__)
* continue lexicalising derivations, in the hope that we can turn off more derivations for the speller and make the PLX fullform list even smaller (__Thomas__()
* compile a new speller when more bugs are fixed, and evaluate it (__Tomi, Thomas__)
