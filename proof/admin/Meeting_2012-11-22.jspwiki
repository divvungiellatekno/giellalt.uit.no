!!!Speller meeting

What is needed for a new release:
* a working installer
* working plx conversion

!!!Installer

__DONE:__
* find e-mail address for UiT/IT staff that has helped us earlier, send e-mail

__TODO:__
* test MSI package, esp. with admin install and different Win/Office combos
  (__UiT/IT, Sjur__)

__POSTPONED:__
* find an outsourcing option (__Børre, Sjur__)
* next week: try updating NSIS ourselves (__Børre, Sjur__)
** using Tino's documentation & old docu's from PLX
* send a request to an NSIS developer e-mail list (__Sjur__)
* try to find an NSIS script for building MSI packages (__Børre__)
* add Windows 8 support to our installer (if possible)

!!!PLX conversion

The latest PLX file is substantially smaller than earlier, only 6,5 Gb vs 25+ Gb earlier.
The change has happened during the last day or two.

One ommission - that can't explain the reduced size - is that particles like ''almma, bat, ges, han'' have been lost in the latest spellers.

Remaining PLX bugs:
