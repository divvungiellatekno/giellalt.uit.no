# Speller meeting

Release planning

What is needed for a new release:
* a working installer
* working plx conversion

# Installer

The answer from the company in Tromsø, Jupiter:

Suggests investigating on an hourly basis, ~ 1.000,- NOK/hour.

But we have another option: Tino Didriksen, also investigate whether he can do the full speller/proofing tools package for us, e.g. based on hfst/foma/vfst.

Basic requirements for the installer and the installed package:
* proper registry entries of MS Office, all variants for all versions 2003-2010
    - exception: we do **not** support 64-bit Office
* must work on Windows 7, all variants, including 64-bits
* installed proof binaries are made for Windows XP-Windows 7, Office 2003-2010

* preferably NSIS
* must be scriptable and cross-compilable
* if not NSIS, the tool must be able to build multilingual installers, with
  support for all Saami languages

**DONE:**
* get a proper quote from the Tromsø company regarding a fixed installer/fixed
  registry entries (**Børre**)

**TODO:**
* needs an answer that we will investigate a couple of other options before we
  decide (**Børre**)
* check out some details from the friend of Tomi, and perhaps a price from the
  friend (of the friend) (**Tomi**)
* write to Tino and ask whether he can do it, and for what price (**Sjur**)

# PLX conversion

Tomi is compiling a new speller on the XServe now. Results on Monday. Thomas has
added the words that fails in the speller test bench to the PLX conversion test
bench data sets.

**TODO:**
* work on test bench improvements (**Tomi**)
    - working
* fix the remaining failures in the speller conversion (**Tomi**)

# Release plan

Meeting every afternoon, solving one issue at a time until we have a release candidate.
