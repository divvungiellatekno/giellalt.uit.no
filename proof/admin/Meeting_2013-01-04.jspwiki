# Speller meeting

What is needed for a new release:
* a working installer
* working plx conversion

# Installer

Nothing new since the previous meeting.

There's [a separate document](WindowsInstallationTest.html) containing the test results for different combinations of MS Office and Windows  versions.

**DONE:**

**TODO:**
* look at combinations of Windows XP and Office (**Børre**)
* get a proper MS certificate, to remove the warning users get when installing (**Børre**)

**POSTPONED:**
* find an outsourcing option (**Børre, Sjur**)
* next week: try updating NSIS ourselves (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - using Tino's documentation & old docu's from PLX
* send a request to an NSIS developer e-mail list (**Sjur**)
* try to find an NSIS script for building MSI packages (**Børre**)
* add Windows 8 support to our installer (if possible)

**DONE:**
* **Tomi** has solved almost all PLX bugs

**TODO:**
* solve the remaining PLX bugs one by one (**Tomi**)

# Release plan

The December 1 goal has passed, without meeting the targets. On the plus side is that the number of open PLX bugs have been greatly reduced, and Tomi are squashinhg PLX bugs all the time. It just takes more time than anticipated.

1. build a new speller with the remaining bug fixes (**Tomi**)
1. tag the present state with the string `Divvun2.3RC1` (**Tomi**)
1. update the adjectives with the noun changes (**Tomi**)
1. make new installers with latest SME speller (**Sjur**)
1. test newest speller in Word (**Thomas**)
1. release a public release candidate tomorrow morning (**Sjur**)

**TODO:**
1. build a new speller with the remaining bug fixes (**Tomi**)
1. test against gold standard corpus (**Sjur**)
1. release RC2 January 15 (**Sjur**)
1. if no new serious bugs are found, release as Divvun 2.3 tomorrow afternoon (**all**)
    1. update list of known bugs
    1. write a short press release emphasising the linguistic updates for North Sámi, and noting that we still have certain problems with Win7/Office2010
