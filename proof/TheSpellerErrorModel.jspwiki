This document describes the different parts of the error model used to create
suggestions for the spellers, how they interact, and how one can turn the
different parts on and off.

!!!Makefile configurations

The file {{tools/spellcheckers/fstbased/desktop/hfst/Makefile.am}} looks like
this, with default values as given by the {{und/}} template:

{{{
# This is the default weight for all editing operations in the error model:
DEFAULT_WEIGHT=10

# Edit distanse for the Levenshtein error model:
EDIT_DISTANCE=2

# Define whether we allow changes to the initial letter(s) in the error model,
# possible values are:
# * no    - no longer string edits = only the default, letter-based error model
# * txt   - use only the txt file as source
# * regex - use only the regex file as source
# * both  - use both the txt and regex files as sources
# NB!!! Setting this to anything but 'no' will greatly increase the size and
# search space of the error model, and thus make it much, much slower. Make sure
# you TEST the resulting error model properly and thoroughly, both for speed
# and suggestion quality.
INITIAL_EDITS=no

# Variable to define whether to enable edits of longer strings (as opposed to
# single letters). Possible values are:
# * no    - no longer string edits = only the default, letter-based error model
# * txt   - use only the txt file as source
# * regex - use only the regex file as source
# * both  - use both the txt and regex files as sources
STRING_EDITS=txt
# Variable to specify the edit distance for the regex
# version of the strings file. The total edit distance for those operations is
# this value multiplied with the value of the DEFAULT_EDIT_DIST variable.
STRING_REGEX_EDIT_DISTANCE=2

# Variable to define whether to enable edits of word-final strings (as opposed
# to single letters). Possible values are:
# * no    - no longer string edits = only the default, letter-based error model
# * txt   - use only the txt file as source
# * regex - use only the regex file as source
# * both  - use both the txt and regex files as sources
FINAL_STRING_EDITS=no

# Variable to define whether to enable whole-word replacements. Possible values:
# - yes
# - no
WORD_REPLACEMENTS=no
}}}

The different options are described above in the comments. In the following
discussion only the relevant options are listed. We'll start with a minimal
error model:

{{{
DEFAULT_WEIGHT=10
EDIT_DISTANCE=2
INITIAL_EDITS=no
STRING_EDITS=no
FINAL_STRING_EDITS=no
WORD_REPLACEMENTS=no
}}}

That is, the error model only contains a Levenshtein edit distance 2 error model
with no additional components. It looks something like this:

[../images/SimpleErrorModel.png]

The file used to specify the letters of the error model is:

{{{
tools/spellcheckers/fstbased/desktop/hfst/editdist.default.txt
}}}

In that file you specify the whole alphabet used for the error model (that is,
all and only the letters you want to be modified).
