The Divvun project provides hyphenation for the following host
applications:

-   [MS Office](MSOff/index.html)
-   [Adobe InDesign CS5.5 / OpenOffice](OOo/index.html)

The integration with MS Office and Adobe InDesign CS3 is done by
[Polderland](http://www.polderland.nl/), as it is for the spellers as
well.

Adobe InDesign CS5.5 supports the same spellers and hyphenators as
[OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) or
[LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/), which means
[Hunspell](http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/) as the speller engine, and
the Tex-based hyphenation pattern lists for hyphenation.

We are presently working on adding hyphenation for InDesign CS5.5 and
OpenOffice, the target release date is April 1.
