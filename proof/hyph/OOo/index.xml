	  <p>An OpenOffice.org hyphenator was not a fixed part of the original plan,
	  rather it was indicated as an optional addition. Part of the reason for
	  this was that at the time I could not find information on how to implement
	  it. Now the information is there (or: we have found it), and we'll try to
	  add SÃ¡mi hyphenation after we have the OOo speller in place. Relevant
	  links are:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/hyphenator.html">OOo Lingucomponent, hyphenation</a>, includes a brief how-to</li>
	    <li><a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries">OOo Dictionary Wiki</a>, with link to hyphenation dictionary creation tool</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>More information will be added when we start the work on the OOo
	  hyphenator.</p>
