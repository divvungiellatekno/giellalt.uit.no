   <body>
      <p>An OpenOffice.org hyphenator was not a fixed part of the original plan, rather it was indicated as an optional
      addition. Part of the reason for this was that at the time I could not find information on how to implement it.
      Now the information is there (or: we have found it), and we'll try to add SÃ¡mi hyphenation after we have the OOo
      speller in place. Relevant links are:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/lingucomponent/hyphenator.html">OOo Lingucomponent, hyphenation</a>,
         includes a brief how-to</li>
         <li><a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries">OOo Dictionary Wiki</a>, with link to
         hyphenation dictionary creation tool</li>
         <li>A copy of the <a href="userguide-p.pdf">user manual</a> for <a
         href="http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xantos/patlib/">OPatGen</a> (see below) is available.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Basically, the task of creating TeX hyphenation pattern files consis of the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>print the lower side of a hyphenated, normative transducer to produce a correctly hyphenated word list</li>
         <li>run that list through <code>OPatGen</code> (see above) and associated scripts - see the user documentation
         above</li>
         <li>test the result</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We need to install <code>OPatGen</code> first, which in turn needs <code>cweave</code>.</p>
      <p>Steps to install <code>cweave</code>:</p>
      <source>sudo port install texlive-bin-extra</source>
      <p>Steps to install <code>opatgen</code> (we have a local copy of the code):</p>
      <ol>
         <li><code>cd $GTHOME/tools/patlib</code></li>
         <li><p><code>make</code><br/> <strong>NB!</strong> At the moment the C compilation is broken, because the code
         rely on a number of old, non-conformant coding practices. <code>gcc 2.95</code> is required, which is not
         available on any modern systems anymore. We either need to upgrade the code, or find an alternative
         solution.</p> <p>We have successfully modernised the code of <code>tools/dic2traskelet.C</code> (a helper
         tool), but the C code of the main application is a bit more complex to cover.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <section>
         <title>The alternative solution</title>
         <p>The <code>OPatGen</code> route is too time-consuming, so we need an alternative. Probably the simplest
         alternative is to use the original <code>PatGen</code> tool, which differs from <code>OPatGen</code> in two
         important respects:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>it does not support Unicode, so all non-ASCII chars must be escaped</li>
            <li>it comes with almost every TeX installation, and should be available everywhere</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The steps needed to create the hyphenation patterns are almost the same, with the addition of the need to
         escape the non-ASCII characters. In more detail, it looks like the following:</p>
