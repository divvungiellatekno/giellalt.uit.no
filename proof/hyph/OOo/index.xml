	  <p>An OpenOffice.org hyphenator was not a fixed part of the original plan,
	  rather it was indicated as an optional addition. Part of the reason for
	  this was that at the time I could not find information on how to implement
	  it. Now the information is there (or: we have found it), and we'll try to
	  add SÃ¡mi hyphenation after we have the OOo speller in place. Relevant
	  links are:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/lingucomponent/hyphenator.html"
	       >OOo Lingucomponent, hyphenation</a>, includes a brief how-to</li>
	    <li><a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries">OOo
	       Dictionary Wiki</a>, with link to hyphenation dictionary creation
	       tool</li>
	    <li>We have a copy of a pdf file <a href="userguide-p.pdf">userguide-p.pdf</a> written for <a href="http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xantos/patlib/">patlib</a></li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>Basically, the task of creating TeX hyphenation files consist of the
	  following steps:</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>print the lower side of a hyphenated, normative transducer to
	       produce a correctly hyphenated word list</li>
	    <li>run that list through OPatGen (see PatLib above) and associated
	       scripts</li>
	    <li>test the result</li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>Steps to take to install patlib:</p>
	  <ol>
	     <li>wget -r http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xantos/patlib/src/</li>
	     <li></li>
	  </ol>
