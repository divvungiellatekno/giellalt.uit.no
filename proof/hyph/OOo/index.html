      <p>An OpenOffice.org hyphenator was not a fixed part of the original plan, rather it
         was indicated as an optional
         addition. Part of the reason for this was that at the time I could not find information
         on how to implement it.
         Now the information is there (or: we have found it), and we'll try to add Sámi hyphenation
         after we have the OOo
         speller in place. Relevant links are:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/lingucomponent/hyphenator.html">OOo Lingucomponent, hyphenation</a>,
            includes a brief how-to
         </li>
         <li><a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries">OOo Dictionary Wiki</a>, with link to
            hyphenation dictionary creation tool
         </li>
         <li>A copy of the <a href="userguide-p.pdf">user manual</a> for <a href="http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xantos/patlib/">OPatGen</a> (see below) is available.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Basically, the task of creating TeX hyphenation pattern files consis of the following
         steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>print the lower side of a hyphenated, normative transducer to produce a correctly
            hyphenated word list
         </li>
         <li>run that list through <code>OPatGen</code> (see above) and associated scripts - see the user documentation
            above
         </li>
         <li>test the result</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We need to install <code>OPatGen</code> first, which in turn needs <code>cweave</code>.
      </p>
      <p>Steps to install <code>cweave</code>:
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">sudo port install texlive-bin-extra</pre>
      <p>Steps to install <code>opatgen</code> (we have a local copy of the code):
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li><code>cd $GTHOME/tools/patlib</code></li>
         <li>
            <p><code>make</code><br> <strong>NB!</strong> At the moment the C compilation is broken, because the code
               rely on a number of old, non-conformant coding practices. <code>gcc 2.95</code> is required, which is not
               available on any modern systems anymore. We either need to upgrade the code, or find
               an alternative
               solution.
            </p> 
            <p>We have successfully modernised the code of <code>tools/dic2traskelet.C</code> (a helper
               tool), but the C code of the main application is a bit more complex to cover.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <h1>The alternative solution</h1>
      <p>The <code>OPatGen</code> route is too time-consuming, so we need an alternative. Probably the simplest
         alternative is to use the original <code>PatGen</code> tool, which differs from <code>OPatGen</code> in two
         important respects:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>it does not support Unicode, so all non-ASCII chars must be escaped</li>
         <li>it comes with almost every TeX installation, and should be available everywhere</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The steps needed to create the hyphenation patterns are almost the same, with the
         addition of the need to
         escape the non-ASCII characters. In more detail, it looks like the following:
