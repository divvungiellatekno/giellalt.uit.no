    <title>Hyphenation testing documentation</title>
  </header>

  <body>
    <p>Hyphenation testing follows the same automatic test bench setup as for
    the spellers. The following tests will soon be available (it depends on
    the availability of the command line hyphenator, which should be ready for
    download within days):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>regression test</li>

      <li>baseform comparison test</li>

      <li>correct test</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is possible that we also can provide hyphenation for OpenOffice, but
    nothing is decided yet.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Regression testing</title>

      <p>Regression testing takes as input a set of known problematic words,
      ie words we have seen have been wrongly hyphenated. These words are sent
      through the hyphenator, and the result is compared to the expected
      hyphenation pattern. Finally a test report is generated, which is
      transformed to Forrest xml, and can be viewed directly in a web browser
      if Forrest is running.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Baseform comparison testing</title>

      <p>The point of this test is to compare the hyphenation output from our
      Polderland hyphenators (InDesign, MS Office) with that of our
      hyphenating transducer. The input is all baseforms in our lexicon (ie no
      dynamic compounds), which are then sent through both our hyphenating
      transducer as well as the command line hyphenator from Polderland.</p>

      <p>The result is compared, and all diffs are reported back as bugs in
      one or the other hyphenator. This test report is also XML, transformed
      to Forrest XML, which are then directly viewable in your web browser of
      choice.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Correct testing</title>

      <p>The input is here a list of (manually) correctly hyphenated words.
      The words are sent through the hyphenator (with the manually added
      hyphenation points removed), and the result is compared to the facit.
      The test report produced will highlight any differences, and give a
      quality score.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Hyphenation engine</title>

      <p>As for the spellers, one can test different hyphenator engines.
      Presently we have only one (soon, that is), the Polderland command line
      hyphenator. But in the future, expect to see other implementations as
      well, such as ones for OpenOffice.org. The engine can be selected with a
      make command option, as follows:</p>

      <source>make hyp-regr-test TARGET=sme TOOL=pl</source>

      <p>The above command will run the regression test for North SÃ¡mi, using
      the Polderland command line hyphenator as the hyphenation engine.</p>

      <p>The hyphenating transducers are not really hyphenator engines, but is
      used as a reference point to compare the output of the other engines
      against. Still, there is of course a chance that it also produces wrong
      results, and both the correct test and the regression test can be used
      to ensure that the hyphenating transducers are behaving correctly, at
      least for the sample given in the test data. The <code>TOOL</code> code
      for the transducer is <code>tx</code>.</p>
