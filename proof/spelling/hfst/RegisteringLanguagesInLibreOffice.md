The process of adding languages in LibreOffice is documented here:


* <https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/LibreOffice_Localization_Guide/How_To_Submit_New_Locale_Data>
* [The Locale Generator](http://www.it46.se/localegen/select_lang.php) (for generating new locale data)
* [How to add the new language](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/LibreOffice_Localization_Guide)


Save the resulting xml file  in the `techdoc/proof/spelling/hfst/locale/` folder.


Thereafter, the new language must be added to LO. Register at
<https://bugs.freedesktop.org/>, and file a bug saying the language is missing, 
with the xml file as an attachment.
