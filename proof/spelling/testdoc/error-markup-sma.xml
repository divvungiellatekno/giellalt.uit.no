      <title>Error markup</title>

   <body>
      <p>We want to extend (some of) the corpus files with markup for spelling and other errors,
         to use them as gold
         standards for testing our spellers (and in the future other tools as well). The markup
         is done manually, and needs
         to follow certain rules.

      <h1>SMA - South Sámi</h1>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Possible values for <em>errtype</em>::
               </strong><br>( ??? )
         </li>
         <li><strong>Comments to each <em>errtype</em> value:
               </strong><br>
            
            <ul>
               <li>???</li>
            </ul>
            
         </li>
         <li><strong>Comments to some <em>pos</em> values:
               </strong><br>
            
            <ul>
               <li>typo = typical typo — as a POS value?</li>
               <li>mix = used with errtype=ncmp, since the correct form is made of several words/POS's.
                  Problem: there is no such <em>errtype</em> value, only <em>wcmp</em> and <em>cmp</em>.
               </li>
            </ul>
            
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>By following these guidelines the resulting files should be readily useable for (speller)
         testing, as soon as
         they are converted to xml.
