        <title>Error markup</title>
    </header>
    <body>
        <p>We want to extend (some of) the corpus files with markup for spelling and other errors, to use them as gold
            standards for testing our spellers (and in the future other tools as well). The markup is done manually, and needs
            to follow certain rules.</p>

             <dl>
                   <dt>Possible values for <em>errtype</em>:</dt>
                   <dd>( ??? )</dd>
                   <dt>Comments to each <em>errtype</em> value</dt>
                   <dd>
                       <ul>
                           <li>???</li>
                       </ul>
                   </dd>
                   <dt>Comments to some <em>pos</em> values</dt>
                   <dd>
                       <ul>
                           <li>typo = typical typo — as a POS value?</li>
                           <li>mix = used with errtype=ncmp, since the correct form is made of several words/POS's.
                             Problem: there is no such <em>errtype</em> value, only <em>wcmp</em> and <em>cmp</em>.</li>
                       </ul>
                   </dd>
             </dl>
        </section>
        <p>By following these guidelines the resulting files should be readily useable for (speller) testing, as soon as
        they are converted to xml.</p>
