        <title>Error markup</title>
    </header>
    <body>
        <p>We want to extend (some of) the corpus files with markup for spelling and other errors, to use them as gold
            standards for testing our spellers (and in the future other tools as well). The markup is done manually, and needs
            to follow certain rules.</p>

        <p>By following these guidelines the resulting files should be readily usable for (speller) testing, as soon as
        they are converted to xml.</p>
