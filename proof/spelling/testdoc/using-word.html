      <title>AppleScript Spell-checker</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p>The possibility to use an <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/applescript/">AppleScript</a>
         to drive the spell checker in MS Word is now documented as part of the
         regular <a href="howtotest.html">automated testing documentation</a>. The
         applescript itself is found in
         <code>gt/script/spellcheckWithMSWord.applescript</code>. Below follows a
         short description of how to run the applescript stand-alone, its input
         parameters and data, and the output data.
      </p>
      <h1>Running the applescript</h1>
      <p>The script takes the following three input parameters:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>LANGUAGE code:
               </strong><br>a three-letter language code identifying the language of the text
            to be proofread. The codes are automatically mapped to the
            corresponding language identifiers used by MS Word. The following
            codes are recognised:
            <ul>
               <li>sme (in MS Word this equals Catalan)</li>
               <li>smj (in MS Word this equals Basque)</li>
               <li>nob</li>
               <li>nno</li>
               <li>swe</li>
               <li>fin</li>
               <li>isl</li>
               <li>dan</li>
               <li>eng</li>
               <li>ger</li>
               <li>deu</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li><strong>INPUT file:
               </strong><br>The text to be proofread. It must be encoded in UTF-16. Presently
            the script expects the text to be preprocessed and filtered, such that
            all words are on one line, and words containing any of <code>[-.:
               ]</code> are removed (these chars "breaks" the input strings into
            separate "words" in MS Word - it might be possible to work around, but
            it isn't worth the effort right now.
         </li>
         <li><strong>OUTPUT file:
               </strong><br>The result of the spell-check is stored in this file, in a format
            described below. The output is as well encoded in UTF-16.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is necessary to run the script from a local terminal session, for
         the script to be able to open MS Word in the graphical UI of MacOS
         X.
      </p>
      <p>The actual command to run the script should be something like:</p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">osascript script/spellcheckWithMSWord.applescript sme InFile OutFile</pre>
      <h2>Remarks on language codes</h2>
      <p>In the standard distribution in the Nordic countries, proofing
         tools for more languages than listed above is installed (and there are
         no tools for Icelandic). It should be easy to expand the list to cover
         all tools installed, or even all languages recognised by MS Word. This
         is left as an exercise for the future.
      </p>
      <h1>Format of the output file</h1>
      <p>The output file is a TAB-delimited text file of the following
         format:
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">InputWord&lt;TAB&gt;SpellerStatus&lt;TAB&gt;Suggestions</pre>
      <p>The suggestions are themselves TAB-separated.</p>
      <p>The SpellerStatus field can have two values:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>SplCor:
               </strong><br>The speller thinks that the input is correct
         </li>
         <li><strong>SplErr:
               </strong><br>The speller thinks that the input is incorrect, ie a
            misspelling
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>The AppleScript</h1>
      <p>Here follows a simple pseudocode of the AppleScript. See the source
         file for the gory details.
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>First we setup input and output files</li>
         <li>Then the language code is mapped to the corresponding language
            constant in MS Word (the constants have the form of strings, like
            <em>norwegian bokmol</em>), and the whole document is set to that
            language
         </li>
         <li>Then, for each word in the input document:
            <ol>
               <li>ask for its spelling status</li>
               <li>print out the result from the speller, together with any
                  suggestions
               </li>
            </ol>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <h1>Testing other languages</h1>
      <p>Since the applescript does not rely on any specific spelling engine,
         but is just querying MS Word for the spelling status of individual
         words, it is possible to test any language for which there is an
         installed speller.
      </p>
      <p>Among other things, this makes it possible to compare the spellers of
         different languages, both from the same vendor and from different
         vendors, given that the test documents share sufficiently similar
         spelling error characteristics.
      </p>
      <h1>Limitations</h1>
      <p>Although the applescript option provides the benefit of being speller
         engine independent, it has its limitations.
      </p>
      <h2>Speed</h2>
      <p>Scripting the speller in MS Word is slow, even more so as MS Word
         2004 is not running natively on the latest and greatest Intel
         Macs.
      </p>
      <h2>Input data</h2>
      <p>Because of Word's built-in string segmentation in its AppleScript
         implementation, some possible input words are not feasible test data.
         This is very unfortunate, since it means that the scripted speller
         behaves differently from the interactive speller for some types of
         input. This is at least true for the following chars:
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">- (hyphen)
: (colon)
. (full stop)</pre>
      <p>Technically it means that Word's definition of a word in
         AppleScript is different from what it is when used interactively.
         Basically, the above characters are considered non-word chars, and
         will split strings containing them into separate words on each side of
         the chars. In practice, this means that we can't meaningfully test
         words of the type:
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">CD:s (in/on the CD)
TV-stasjåvnnå (TV station)
cand.phil.</pre>
      <p>Since including such words in the test data will just destroy the
         test results, they are removed before the test is run. The test result
         is because of this not completely covering all cases, but removing
         such words is better than destroying the test results.
      </p>
      <h2>Platform dependence</h2>
      <p>Because we are using AppleScript, it only runs on the Mac. But the
         underlying AppleScript implementation in Word is based on VisualBasic
         (VB), and is very close to the VB scripting found in Word for Windows.
         It should thus be relatively straightforward for someone knowing VB to
         port this script to run on Windows using VB.
