        <title>Error markup</title>
    </header>
    <body>
        <p>We want to extend (some of) the corpus files with markup for spelling and other errors, to use them as gold
            standards for testing our spellers (and in the future other tools as well). The markup is done manually, and needs
            to follow certain rules.</p>

             <title>ISL - Icelandic markup</title>
             <p>Description of <em>the error classification</em> for ISL:</p>
             <dl>
                   <dt>cmp</dt>
                   <dd>compound errors, subclasses:
                       <ul>
                           <li>1-X: the word is 1, should have been split in X words (X ≤ 2, specify X)</li>
                           <li>X-1: the word is split on X words, but should have been one (X ≤ 2, specify X)</li>
                           <li>st-gensg: the stem is used for the left part, but genitive sing. should have been used</li>
                           <li>st-genpl: the stem is used for the left part, but genitive plur. should have been used</li>
                           <li>gensg-genpl: genitive sing. is used, should have been gen pl</li>
                           <li>gen-st: genitive (unspecified) is used, the stem should have been used</li>
                       </ul>
                   </dd>
                   <dt>Comments to some <em>pos</em> values</dt>
                   <dd>
                       <ul>
                           <li>typo = typical typo — as a POS value?</li>
                           <li>mix = used with errtype=ncmp, since the correct form is made of several words/POS's.
                             Problem: there is no such <em>errtype</em> value, only <em>wcmp</em> and <em>cmp</em>.</li>
                       </ul>
                   </dd>
