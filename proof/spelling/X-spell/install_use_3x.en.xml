			<title>Install dictionaries</title>
			
			<warning>The proofing tools for OpenOffice.org are still in <strong>BETA</strong>. Although they are maturing, there are <em>known linguistic bugs</em> in there, especially related to compounds.</warning>

			<note>
				These installation instructions are for <em>OpenOffice.org 3.x</em>. We also have <a href="installation_use.html">installation instructions for OpenOffice.org 2.4.x</a>
			</note>
			
			<p>Download <a href="http://divvun.no/static_files/smi.oxt">the OOo extension with the spelling dictionaries</a>:<br/>

				<title>Installing an extension for the current user</title>
			
				<p>There are several ways to install an extension.</p>
				
				<section>
					<title>Using the Extension Manager dialog.</title>
					
					<p>Open the Extension Manager via Tools-Extension Manager. Click the "Add" button, select the extension in the file chooser dialog and click "OK". You may need to accept a license or agree to replace an existing version of an extension.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<title>From the download dialog</title>

					<p>When you are about to download an extension the browser or e-mail program may show a dialog where you can choose to open the file with OpenOffice.org or to save it on disk. In the first case, OpenOffice.org will be started and installs the extension. You will be asked if you want to continue installing the extension. Press "OK" to install it.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<title>By double-clicking</title>

					<p>Double-clicking the extension in a file browser will cause the extension to be installed. The procedure is the same as described before. That is, OpenOffice.org is started, users are asked if they want to continue the installation, and so on.</p>

    			<title>Installing an extension for all users</title>

    			<p>To install extensions for all users it is necessary to have write access to the office installation. Open the Extension Manager dialog via Tools-Extension Manager and click the "Add" button. After having selected an extension one will be asked to install it for oneself or all users. Choose "all users".</p>

            <title>Using the speller</title>
            <note>Because Sami localisation is not in place for OpenOffice.org, the Sami languages will only appear when you choose <strong>Tools > Language > For Selection > More...</strong> or <strong>Tools > Language > For Paragraph > More...</strong></note>
            <ul>
                <li>Write some text, then select it all</li>
    			<li>Goto <strong>Tools > Language > For Selection > More...</strong>: <br />
    			 <img src="ooo8.png" alt="Language menu" /></li>
	       		<li>Choose the <strong>Font</strong> tab in the dialog that appears: <br />
	       		 <img src="ooo9.png" alt="Font dialog" /></li>
			    <li>Choose the wanted language in the <strong>Language</strong> menu: <br />
			     <img src="ooo10.png" alt="Choose speller language" /></li>
            </ul>
