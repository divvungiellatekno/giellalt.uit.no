This is some initial notest regarding our development of a
hunspell-based spell checker for OpenOffice.org.

[Hunspell](http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/) is the chosen default
speller engine in newer versions of
[OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org/), and provides most of the
functionality we need, although no real support for morphophonology is
available.
