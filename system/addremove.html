<h1>Adding and removing users</h1>

<p>Be root. To add a new user named Laila Sara with laila as the user
name, do the following:</p>

<p>You will need <i>nnnnn</i>, the next free uid number, the numbers start with
10000 for trond. Check out the next number by typing <code>tail
/etc/passwd</code>. Say it is 501.<p>

<p>Then make the group laila:</p>

<p><code>/usr/sbin/groupadd -g 501 laila</code></p>

<p>Then make the new user. Write the following command.  It shall be written in one line,
but is here written on multiple lines for readability. </p>
<p>
<pre>
 /usr/sbin/useradd
 -u 501 
 -g 501 
 -G cvs 
 -c "Laila Sara, Samisk inst."  
 laila
</pre></p>

<p>The user must own her own catalogue, but others may want to read it. This is achieved by writing:</p>

<p><code>chown laila:laila /home/laila</code></p>
<p><code>chmod 0755 /home/laila</code></p>

<p>Then assign the new user a password, by writing:</p>

<p><code>passwd laila</code></p>

<p>Remember to copy the .bashrc, .bash_profile and .emacs files to the
laila account while you are still a root user. Remember to run the
initial "cvs get" command.</p>

<p>If the user has forgot his/her own password, log in as root, and enter
the command "passwd laila". You will not be prompted for the old
password, and the new one you enters will erase the old one.</p>

<h3>Removing users</h3>

<p>For removing (in this example the user laila), be root, and use this
command (-r removes the files of the user al well):</p>

<p><pre>
/usr/sbin/userdel -r laila
rm -r /export/home/laila
cd /var/yp
make 
</pre></p>

<p>A general warning: The commands that the manuals say should work, do
work, if you just write /sbin/ in front of them, i.e. prbably
/sbin/userdel instead of userdel.</p>
