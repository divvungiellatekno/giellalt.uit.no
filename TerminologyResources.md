# Terminology Resources

The only terminology resource at present is a WikiMedia based TermWiki for the S치mi languages in Finland, Norway and Sweden, and the corresponding majority languages.

Named [S치mi Giellag치ldu TermWiki](https://satni.uit.no/termwiki), the content is maintained by [Giellag치ldu](https://www.giella.org), and the MediaWiki infrastructure is maintained and developed by the [Divvun group](https://divvun.no).

The terminology developed and maintained within the Termwiki is published on [satni.org](http://satni.org).
All terminology and dictionary content is also available via a REST API (documentation forthcoming).

Terminology resources for other language groups will be added here as they become available.
