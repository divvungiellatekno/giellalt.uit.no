# Project Planning

Participants:
* Hanna
* Michael

Place:
* Freiburg

Time:
* 30 April 2014, 4–5pm

Topics
*the N-Kurdish texts are still in the preparing phase, [ELAN](../ELAN.html)-files of the digitized transcription are being annotated, but the English translation from Kurdish takes much more time than estimated
*therefore Hanna will use only a few Kurdish texts for her pilote study, but include Skolt Saami (the Lagercrantz-texts digitized by Julia) instead, these Skolt Saami texts are all already translated and pos-tagging is almost finished
*our working copies of the [ELAN](../ELAN.html)-files for the Kurdish/Skolt pilote study will be subversioned on Tromsø-SVN; copyright allows us to store the N-Kurdish data in the open domain (i.e. freecorpus)
*however, our preliminary solution for collaborative work on the [ELAN](../ELAN.html)-files is still Dropbox until Hanna has her new computer with Linux/Unix and is registered at victorio

Open questions:
* Hanna: which other Kurdish languages to include in the final study?
* Michael: which other Saami languages to include in the final study?

Tasks:
* Hanna: check wether or not there are any computational linguistic tools and/or electronic lexical databases available for Kurdish (or perhaps closely related languages)
* Michael: adjust the [ELAN](../ELAN.html)-tier structure once the annotations of the first files are completed
* Michael: create two additional tiers for [GRAID](../GRAID.html)'s "form" and "function" tags and document this in an appendix for the the GRAID manual

Next meeting:
* 14 May Freiburg
