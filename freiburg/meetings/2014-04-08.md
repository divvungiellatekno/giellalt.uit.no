# Project Planning

Participants:
* Hanna
* Michael

Place:
* Freiburg

Time:
* 8 April 2014, 1–3pm

Topic 1: presentation of planned pilot study by Hanna
* N-Kurdish, ~14.000 words, 7 texts recorded ~50-100 years ago, transcribed and translated (no original audio)
* creating [ELAN](../ELAN.html)-files of the digitized transcription, devided into sentences (work finished)
* manually annotating according to [GRAID](../GRAID.html) conventions (work started)
* analyzes (work planned to be done in April)

Topic 2: discussion
* possible improvements in ELAN-tier structure (according to [other Freiburg corpus projects](/freiburg/freiburg.html)
* possible workflows for collaborative work between Freiburg, Bamberg, Tromsø
* language for second pilot study will be Skolt Saami (Lagercrantz-texts digitized by Julia)

Open questions:
* where to store our working copies of the [ELAN|../ELAN.html]-files: SVN, Git-Hub, [TLA](../TLA.html), other?, preliminary solution is Dropbox
* can we use computational linguistic tools for (semi-) automatic annotation of Kurdish?
* which other Kurdish languages to include in the final study?
* which other Saami languages to include in the final study?

Tasks:
* Hanna checks copyright issues for the Kurdish texts
* Hanna checks wether or not there are any computational linguistic tools available for Kurdish
* Micha adjusts the [ELAN](../ELAN.html)-tier structure once the annotations of the first file are completed

Next meeting:
* 30 April Freiburg (RegEx training together with members of the [other Freiburg corpus projects](/freiburg/freiburg.html))
