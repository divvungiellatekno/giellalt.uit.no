This page documents transcription conventions applied in the [ELAN|ELAN.html] annotations of the [Freiburg-Tromsø Speech Corpora|freiburg.html].

Since the audio/video remains linked to our onnotations in ELAN, we do not need very complicated transcription conventions marking overlapping speech, and other nuances, like hesitations, different lenghts for pauses, etc. Instead, we aim for a simple orthographic transcription and need only very few special tags in the transcription tier.


!!!orth (tier)

!!Capitalization and punctuation

It is up to the taste of the annotator whether or not the transcription has to comply with the rules for standard orthography.

!!Punctuation marks

If punctuation marks are used (see above "Capitalization and punctuation") always write a whitespace before them (in order to tokenize them)!

Possible punctuation markes are:
* !
* ? 
* . 
* : 
* ; 
* , 
* "

Note the (syntactic) difference between PUNCT vs. CLB in the punctuation marks! Typical CLB (clause boundaries) are:
* !
* ? 
* . 
* ; 

Possible CLB are:
* : (=marking indirect speech)
* , (=marking combined sentences)


!!Non-speech in text collections

Some authers have symbols or additional explanations in their transcriptions, e.g. Lagercrantz: (Ill.) (1234) … Leave these signs in the text, but put them in parenthesis


!!Other conventions 

Non-comprehensible speech
* (…) = one unclear word
* (…) (…) (three) = two unclear words, the third is perhaps "three"
* Part(…) = unclear ending
* Part(is)anen = I am hearing "is", but I am not quite certain

False start or incomplete articulated word
* hyphen following right after the word, like in Partisa- Partanen

Clear Pause
* … (after whitespace)


Non-spoken parts in the translations
* and [he] sailed away
