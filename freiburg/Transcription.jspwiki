This page documents transcription conventions applied in the [ELAN|ELAN.html] annotations of the [Freiburg-Troms√∏ Speech Corpora|freiburg.html].

Since the audio/video remains linked to our onnotations in ELAN, we do not need very complicated transcription conventions marking overlapping speech, and other nuances, like hesitations, different lenghts for pauses, etc. Instead, we aim for a simple orthographic transcription and need only very few special tags in the transcription tier.
