!Master template (spoken)

|| Level || Name   || Parent || Type        || Explanation
|  0     |  ref     | -      |  ref(spoken)T | gives each utterance a unique number (within the recording)
|        |          |        |               | and aligns it in time relative to the recording
|  -1    |  orth    | ref    |  orthT        | representation of the utterance in the standard orthography
|  –2    |  ft-XYZ  | orth   |  ft-XYZT      | free X-language translation of the utterance (where 'XYZ' is replaced 
|        |          |        |               | with a language code: eng, rus, etc.)
|  –2    |  ft-ling | orth   |  ft-lingT     | morpheme glosses (‘free translation linguistics’); mostly used in PSDP
|        |          |        |               | recordings; morpheme boundary indications based on the [Leipzig glossing rules|http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php]
|  –2    |  word    | orth   |  wordT        | individual tokens (words, punctuation, etc.) of the utterance, each with its own annotation unit;
|        |          |        |               | essentially an exact copy of the ‘orth’-tier, just divided into individual tokens;
|        |          |        |               | ELAN can tokenize automatically
