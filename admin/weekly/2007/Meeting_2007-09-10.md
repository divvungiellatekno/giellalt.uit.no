* [fix bugs!](http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla).

# 3. Documentation

**TODO:**
* add semi-automatic updates of fixed and open issues to README files
  (**Børre**)

# 4. Corpus gathering

We received the correct-marked corpus from Kåre. Some of the errors identified
are non-orthographic: morphosyntactic or lexical. Either we remove those
corrections, or we introduce other markup to differentiate the types (and ignore
non-orthographic errors in the speller tests).

```
  wrong§correct   - orthographic              leif§feil
{wrong}£{correct} - morphosyntactic           {mun muitalat}£{mun muitalan}
  wrong€correct   - lexical/terminological    guossodimieddne€biebbmoieddne
```

The corresponding xml should look like:
```
<error type="ort" correct="feil">leif</error>
<error type="synt" correct="mun muitalan">mun muitalat</error>
<error type="lex" correct="biebbmoieddne">guossodimieddne</error>
```

Decision: processing of the above markup will be implemented for future use, but
it will not be used in the actual markup yet. Non-orthographic correction will
be removed from our present correct documents, to avoid noise in the speller
tests.

**TODO:**
* add `sma` Bible texts to the corpus repository (**Trond**)
* bug **Kåre Tjikkom** about the `smj` correct document (**Sjur**)
    - done, received, very useful, but we could use even more.
* add correct type differentiation to XSL processing (**Saara**)
* add correct type differentiation to ccat (**Tomi**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

Nothing.

# 6. Infrastructure

Nothing.

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

Fixed a long-standing bug last week:)

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Maaren**)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
* fix twol bug (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
    - done!
* add the `sme` place names from Finland (**Ilona**)
    - still working

## Lule Sámi

smj propernoun bug issue:
procedure
1. convert from common base (which means sme base)
    1. Words not convertable should be added to separate smj lexicon, and words that
   should not be converted from sme sme should be moved to non-convert lexicon
   in sme???
1. send to smj morphology

The original todo was to correct the smj morphology.
Current test shows weaknesses in both camps:
* conversion errors
* words that should not have been converten
* missing smj-unique names
* errors in the morphology

Testing procedures: 
* analyse baseforms (as for sme)
* generate a couple of caseforms from  the baseforms, and inspect result

Suggestion:
Let us first analyse the proper noun base forms for Lule Sámi, and thereafter
look at the morphology.

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* `ä/æ` in speller, see bug report #411 (**Tomi, Sjur**)
* lexicalise words from the Olavi missing list, but check against the pdf
  original where in doubt (**Per-Eric**)
* add compounding tags to:
    - nouns (**Thomas**)
        - finished
    - adjs (**Per-Eric**)
        - finished

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

This sub-project needs to get up and running soon. Mainly **Sjur's** task.

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

**TODO:**
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## OOo spellers

TODO:
* add Hunspell data conversion (**Tomi**)

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

See discussion above under the `smj` discussion.

**TODO:**
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)
* move **Steinar's** error markup in the xml files to (a copy of) the original
  (**Børre**)

### Automated testing

```
cat gt/doc/proof/spelling/testing/selftest-pl-sme-20070909.xml | grep \
'<original>' | cut -d">" -f2 | cut -d"<" -f1 | \
lookup -flags mbTT -utf8 gt/sme/bin/sme.fst | grep '\?' | cut -f1 | wc -l
```

Lex test of the lule-specific words. Three were not recognised:

```
Sálatduottar    Sálatduottar    +?
Várjjat Várjjat +?
Fatjatj Fatjatj +?
```

Abbreviations are currectly printed twice if they should be followed by a full
stop - once with and once without the full stop. - Fixed during the meeting.

**TODO:**
* document the AppleScript testing tool (**Sjur**)
    - enhanced, not finished
* document the testing procedures (**Sjur**)

## Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

**TODO:**
* fix bug 484 (**Tomi**)
* fix bug 458 (**Trond, Sjur, Tomi**)
    - done

## New public beta

Delayed till the majority of the present bugs are fixed. The twolc bug 
is the major stopper, as well as 484 and 458.

**Update:** twolc error fixed, as well as 458.

# 10. Other

## Corpus contracts

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra as open-source on NoDaLi-sta
  (**Sjur**)

## Bug fixing

When fixing bugs, record the version number containing the fix in the Bugzilla
bug report, such that for each bug, we know exactly when it should have been
fixed, in what file(s) and what version.

**56** open Divvun/Disamb bugs (**25** of these 56 are speller-related bugs,
**31** are general bugs), and **23** risten.no bugs

## Project meeting

We'll meet in September, 24-28, in Tromsø to work on the hardest remaining
issues.

# 11. Next meeting, closing

The next meeting is 17.9.2007, 09:30 Norwegian time.

The meeting was closed at 11:32 (but it included a lot of regular work as well).
