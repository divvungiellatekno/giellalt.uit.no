# 3. Documentation

Nothing new.

The open documentation issues fall into these three categories:
* Beta documentation for testers
* Documentation for the online corpora
* General documentation improvement after Steinar's test (for open-source
  release)

TODO:
* write form to request corpus user account (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed till after the beta release
* document how to apply for access to closed corpus, and details on the corpus
  and its use in general (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed till after the beta release
* correct and improve it based on feedback from **Steinar** (**Børre**)
    - low priority
* beta documentation (see separate beta section below)

# 4. Corpus gathering

Nothing new.

TODO:
* `sme` texts: no new additions, fix corpus errors during this month
  (**Børre, Trond, Saara**)
* missing `nob` parallel texts should be added if such holes are found
  (**Børre, Trond**)
* Go through the list of missing or errouneous `nob` texts, based upon
  **Saara's** perfect list (**Børre, Trond**)
* add `sma` texts to the corpus repository (**Børre**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## Alignment

All parallell texts are now aligned.
Lars has made some work in Oslo, but no visible changes to the pages yet.

**TODO**
* check with **Lars** when more texts are ready (**Trond**)

# 6. Infrastructure

The [http://giellatekno.uit.no] main page has been restructured, and **Saara's**
nice paradigm generator has been given a more visible place. The North Sámi
generator is in place, but the Lule Sámi one still has not been implemented. On
the downside, the online wordform generators do not work, and all the links now
accidently go to the English rather than the Sámi pages..

**TODO:**
* update and fix our documentation and infrastructure as **Steinar** finds
  problem areas (**Børre**)
* fix internet setup for **Per-Eric's** satelite modem (**Sjur, Børre**)
    - this influences iChat, SEE sharing, and ARD connetions
* Add a Lule Sámi paradigm generators, and link the p-smj.en.html page
to it. (**Saara**)
* Translate the paradigm pages to Sámi, fix all the se links (**Børre, Trond**)

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

Actio compounds not being allowed to compound creates problems for constructions
like: *boahtaladdan- ja vuolggasadji*. We should probably look into whether we
need to open up for actio compounds again, and the disambiguator people should
then find another solution to their problem.

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Maaren**)
    - almost all done
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
    - postponed till after the public beta

## Lule Sámi

*Buorrek* issue: -k clitic (or abessive?)
Clitic issue seems phonological in lulesámi: tjuvdek but not *tjuvdevk, *tjuvdijk, *tjuvdijnk          tjuvdijn ge instead of tjuvdijnk?

What is a clitic? Member of LEXICON K.
1. totally uncritical when it comes to hosts (accept all hosts) <===
1. does not (usually) interfere with the phonology of the host

If you may add -k to all wordforms pointing to the lexicon K today, then -k
should stay in K. If no, it must go.

North sami: we use K instead of #, since basically all words (and word forms)
may get -go, -ba, -ge, etc.

lijge, lage, muorrage - buorrek, *lak

Say, for the sake of the argument that
* -k added to nominal forms
* other K members to any wordform
* ==> calls for split of K lexicon.

```
LEXICON K
 ENDLEX ;
###  +Clt:clitic ENDLEX ;
 +Clt+ge:#ge ENDLEX ;
 +Clt+gen:#gen ENDLEX ;
 +Clt+ga:#ga ENDLEX ;
 +Clt+k:#k ENDLEX ;
```

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* research the *–k* ending, whether it is a clitic or a regular inflection,
  and where it applies (**Per-Eric, Thomas**)

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

**TODO:**
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## OOo speller(s)

TODO after the MS Office Beta is delivered:
* add Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study the Hunspell formalism in detail (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* Manually mark test texts for typos (making them into gold standards)
  (**Steinar**)
    - continued
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not)
* Conduct tests on new beta versions on the basis of the unspoiled gold standard
  documents (**whoever has time**), and fill in data from testing (the testers:
  **who?**)
* include the files already publically tested into the `prooftest` cataloge
  (**Steinar, Trond**)
* test each version before beta release

### Testing tools

**TODO:**
* document the AppleScript testing tool (**Sjur**)
* improve speller test bench (**Sjur**)
    - integrate the ccat speller testing options in the Makefile (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* ask for Linux version of the Polderland command-line speller (for victorio)
  (**Sjur**)

### Regression tests

**TODO:**
* add extraction of all known spelling errors in the corpus (not the
  `prooftest` corpus), and check that they are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - `ccat` now ready, it should be integrated in the Makefile (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* test the `typos.txt` list, and check that all entries are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
* consider how to do a regression **self-test**, ie, how to test the full
  wordlist (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - extract all the base forms in the lexicon, and run them through the speller
    - extract all SUB-marked entries, and run them through the lexicon
        - integrate these in the make file (**Sjur**)

## Localisation

We need to translate the info added to our front page (and a separate page)
regarding the beta release. Also the press release needs to be translated.

TODO:
* translate beta release docs to `sme` (**Thomas**)
* translate beta release docs to `smj` (**Thomas**)

## Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

**Børre** got the conversion working all the way to the final speller, for
`sme`. A new speller lexicon is soon available for download. `smj` is next.

**TODO:**
* ask MacOffice for larger disks for the G5 (**Børre**), and report about
  possible RAM-related problems, and the warranty on the RAM.
    - not yet
* ask for larger disks for victorio (**Børre, Trond**)
    - discussed, in principle *yes*, reluctant to the schedule. But in the end,
   he would be willing to update the disks, but not the OS until June. He will
   send us an e-mail with costs for new disks.
* ask for newer server OS on victorio, many of the installed tools are quite old
  (it is using Cent OS - a new version was released not long ago)
  (**Børre, Trond**)
    - see previous point.
* ask for mklex for Linux (victorio) from Polderland (**Sjur**)
    - not yet (no meeting with them last week)

### Compounding restrictions

How to include compounding restriction comment tags in the transducers:
```
giv0ri:giv'ri ALBMI ; !+SgNomCmp +SgGenCmp +PlGenCmp
=> (using a perl script or similar)
+SgNomCmp+SgGenCmp+PlGenCmpgiv0ri:giv'ri ALBMI ; !
```

**TODO:**
1. improve prefix conversion to PLX (**Tomi**)
1. improve middle noun conversion to PLX (**Tomi**)
1. improve noun + adjective PLX conversion: (**Tomi**)
    1. compounding stems - how do we generate them? Using the java client?
    `+SgNomCmp+Cmpnd` = `sáme–`, should give the correct compounding stem,
    shouldn't it? We want to **optionally** go from: `sáme-	NLI` to
    `sáme	NL`: `-	NLI (->) 	NL`, which means we should be able to
    extract correct compounding stems using xfst methods only.
    1. compounding tags - we need to obey them when making the transducers.
    Suggestion - see above.
1. make conversion test sample; add conversion testing to the make file
  (**Tomi**)
    1. to regression test / QA the PLX conversion.
1. improve number conversion (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. ask for larger disk for the web server (**Trond, Børre**)

## Public Beta release

**TODO:**
* working and updated `smj` speller (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add numbers, compound restrictions to both spellers if time permits
  (**Børre, Tomi**)
* finish press release (**Sjur**)
* add info to front page (incl. download links) (**Børre**)
    - download page made, only needs to add the speller beta when it is ready.
* write separate page with detailed info (incl. download links) (**Børre**)
    - a separate page for the beta speller, with installation instructions, etc.
* translate press release, web pages (**Børre, Thomas, whoever**)
* collect a list of PR recipients, forward to Berit Karen Paulsen
  (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* test final beta speller installers on Windows and Mac (**Børre**)
* update installer packages with latest speller lexicon (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - we need to test the procedure, and make sure it works

# 10. Other

## Corpus contracts

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra as open-source on NoDaLi-sta
  (**Sjur**)
    - **delayed** until the public beta is out the door

## Bug fixing

**35** open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and **23** risten.no bugs

**TODO:**
* look over the Bugzilla status mails (**Børre**)
    - not yet
