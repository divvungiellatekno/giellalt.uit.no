# 3. Documentation

TODO:
* write form to request corpus user account (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* document how to apply for access to closed corpus, and details on the corpus
  and its use in general (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* correct and imrove it based on feedback from **Steinar** (**Børre**)

# 4. Corpus gathering

TODO:
* `sme` texts: no new additions, fix corpus errors during this month
  (**Børre, Trond, Saara**)
* missing `nob` parallel texts should be added if such holes are found
  (**Børre, Trond**)
* Go through the list of missing or errouneous `nob` texts, based upon
  **Saara's** perfect list (**Børre, Trond**)
* add `sma` texts to the corpus repository (**Børre**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## Alignment

Main news: We have a working parallel corpus online.

Notes about the interface (or lack of documentation): the first search field in
the form needs to be filled; to get the parallell texts in the search result,
make sure to click *add phrase* and specify the language to be the other one.

**TODO:**
* go through other directories (nob dicrectories, sd directories), fix 
  parallellity information for other documents (2 hours)
  (**Børre**)

## Conversion issues

**TODO:**
* report conversion errors to **Saara** (**Trond, Steinar**)

# 6. Infrastructure

**Børre** and **Steinar** have both started on the task of testing and
correcting the documentation.

**TODO:**
* test our infrastructure and documentation - follow the documentation exactly,
  and find problem areas - report problems to **Børre**. Start: At the front
  page. (**Steinar**)
* update and fix our documentation and infrastructure as **Steinar** finds
  problem areas (**Børre**)

# 7. Linguistics

## Numbers:

**Thomas** is almost finished with correcting the number part of the `sme`
analyzer.

TODO:
* discontinous case inflection in  `sme` (but only for maximally three-part
  compound numerals) (`viđain/goalmmát/logiin` and `guvttiin/logiin/viđain`)
  (**Thomas**)
* produce correct number base forms in the `sme` analyzer (**Thomas**)
* Go through the `sme` Num bugs (**Thomas**)

## North Sámi

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Maaren**)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)

## Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [the meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

Postponed:

TODO:
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## Polderland data generation

**TODO:**
1. improve number conversion (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. add prefixes to the PLX (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. add derivations to the PLX generation (**Børre, Tomi**)
    1. next after numbers are fixed

## OOo speller(s)

TODO after the MS Office Beta is delivered:
* add Aspell/Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study Hunspell, perhaps also Soikko (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)

## Testing

**TODO:**
* get an Intel Mac for Tomi (**Sjur**)
    - not yet

## Localisation

We need to translate the info added to our front page (and a separate page)
regarding the beta release. Also the press release needs to be translated.

TODO:
* translate beta release docs to `sme` (**Thomas**)
* translate beta release docs to `smj` (**Thomas**)

## Beta release

Tentative beta release: Thursday 15.2. - but it might be delayed till later in
February, since we still have no beta from Polderland.

In the beta, `sme` is now Catalan, whereas `smj` is Basque.

All beta packages (mklex tools, Win and Mac tools) can be copied from **Sjur's**
home dir on the G5:
```
/Users/sjur/mklex.zip
/Users/sjur/SamiProofingtools_beta-Mac.dmg
/Users/sjur/SamiProofingtools_beta-Win.zip
```

mklex -M256 -p sami_north_phon* revInputSamiNort.plx mssp3samiNorthern.lex

SamiNortAsCatalan2007-02sp

The PLX compilers (one each for sme, smj), which compiles the specified source
files into ready speller files (or almost ready in the Mac case), are now
installed on the G5. Follow the instructions given in the Word document found
inside the `mklex.zip` package above PLUS one addition when compiling the Mac
version:

As a last step after the lexicon is compiled, use the tool
`/Developer/Tools/Rez` to add a resource fork with the content in
`gt/sm(e|j)/polderland/*Lex.rsrc.hex` to the lexicon file and tool
`/Developer/Tools/SetFile` to add creator and type and set custom icon. The 
command sequence should be something like the following:

```
cd gt/
export RIncludes=/System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Headers/
/Developer/Tools/Rez sme/polderland/CatalanLex.rsrc.hex -a -o $SpellerLexiconFil
/Developer/Tools/SetFile -a CI -c MSOF -t HMSD $SpellerLexiconFile
```

This step is necessary to make MS Office recognise the speller lexicon file as a
real such file. It will add an icon and a language ID to the file.

PLX files:
* adjectives
    - AdjectiveRoot
* verbs
    - VerbRoot
    - Copula
    - Negativeverb
* nouns
    - NounRoot
* propernouns
    - ProperNoun
* Adverb
* Conjunction
* Interjection
* Particles
* Adposition (pp)
* Pronoun
* Subjunction
* Numerals
* pp

All ok, except numerals.

DONE:
* delivered PLX data of `sme` and `smj` including compounding
* translated Windows installer to `sme` and `smj`
* installed PLX compiler in G5 at `/usr/local/bin/mklex*` (one version for
  `sme` and one for `smj`)
* added resources needed for compiling PLX lexicons to our cvs repo
* tested the beta drop from Polderland - good we did, it is absolutely
  unacceptable (our responsibiliby - only linguistic errors (poor coverage)
  found so far)

TODO:
* write press release (**Sjur**)
    - done first draft, see `xtdoc/sd/.../xdocs/pr/`
* add info to front page (incl. download links) (**Børre**)
* write separate page with detailed info (incl. download links) (**Børre**)
    - **Sjur** wrote a start
* test the beta release from Polderland thoroughly before it is released
  (**all**):
    - download and installation
    - documentation
    - technical performance
    - linguistic performance:
        - true positives (correctly recognised misspellings)
        - false positives (correct words errouneously marked as misspellings)
        - false negatives (misspellings not recognised by the speller)
        - true negatives (correctly spelled words recognised as such by the speller)
        - suggestions
    - all tests on both Mac and Win - Windows only (**Børre, Sjur, Thomas**)
* compile new speller lexicons using the mklex* tools on the G5, following the
  instructions given in the documentation from Polderland (in mklex beta drop)
  (**Tomi, Børre**)
* add compilation of MS Office spellers part of the Makefile (**Tomi**)
* install Windows and MS Office; test tools on Windows (**Børre, Thomas**)
* collect a list of PR recipients, forward to
* questions for Polderland (**Børre**):
    - version info in the speller?
    - remaking/updating the installer packages with linguistic updates - who?

## Compilation

Adjectives compile at 60 sec/adjective, i.e. (5000*60) / 3600 = 83 hrs
Nouns compile at 3 sec/noun,            i.e. (23600*3) / 3600 = 19 hrs

## Testing

Different ways of testing:

1. Impressionistic, functionality: try the program, try all the functions
1. Impressionistic, coverage: try the program on different texts, look for false positives
1. Systematic (in order of importance):
    1. Make a corpus of texts, from different genres (can be done before 0.2 release)
        1. For each text, detect precision
        1. For each text, detect recall
        1. For each text, detect accuracy

Before beta release: precision is important, but have a look at recall as well.

Recall and precision

* precision = tp / ( tp + fp )  = true redlines / all redlines
    - can we trust that the redlines are actually errors?
    - Task: check all hits 
    - (test p, are they tp or fp?)
* recall = tp / ( tp + fn)      = true redlines / all errors in doc
    - can we trust that all errors are actually found? 
    - Task: check every single word 
    - (test p, are they tp or fp, test n, are they tn or fn?)
* accuracy = tp + tn / tp + fp + fn + tn = overall performance

Definitions:

* true positives (correctly recognised misspellings)
* false positives (correct words errouneously marked as misspellings)
* false negatives (misspellings not recognised by the speller)

## Timetable
1. The next beta version (beta 0.2) is ready tuesday at xx h?
1. Testing 0.2: Thomas, Steinar, Trond, Ilona, ...
1. 0.3 compilation starts at thursday
    - what to compile? only the improved *-sm{ej}-lex.txt files
1. The next beta version (beta 0.3) is ready sunday
1. Monday: Testing beta 0.3 for unpleasent surprises
1. We release beta 0.3 on Tuesday, unless there are surprises
1. If there are surprises, we must compile again, this time 0.4
1. Deadline for documentation as already(?) stated

compile a: *sm(e|j)-lex.txt to *-plx.txt = 83 hrs?
sort: *-plx.txt
compile b: -plx.txt to .sp = ? hrs

two-phase sort:

now: 
* cat *plx.txt > sme-plx.txt
* cat sme-plx.txt | sort -r | uniq > all_except_nouns-sme-plx.txt

tomorrow:
* cat noun-sme-plx.txt all_except_nouns-sme-plx.txt | sort -r | uniq > sme-plx.txt
* sort complexity = N

one-phase sort:
* tomorrow:
* cat *plx.txt > sme-plx.txt
* cat sme-plx.txt | sort -r | uniq > all_except_nouns-sme-plx.txt
