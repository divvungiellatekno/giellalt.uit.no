    - Fixed some, actually, and found new ones

# 3. Documentation

**Børre** has done all(!) open issues - thanks!

TODO:
* either fix forrest installations (**Sjur**), or create a new tarball
  (**Børre**)
    - done (new tarball)
* cvs up of the public server should be done for `xtdoc/sd/documentation/`
  - notice the directory! (**Børre**)
    - done
* update setup and installation instructions (**Børre**)
    - done

# 4. Corpus gathering

TODO:
* `sme` texts: no new additions, fix corpus errors during this month
  (**Børre, Trond, Saara**)
* missing `nob` parallel texts should be added if such wholes are found
  (**Børre, Trond**)
* Go through the list of missing or errouneous nob texts, based upon Saaras
  perfect list (**Børre, Trond**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## Aligner

**TODO:**
* make an overview of status quo (**Trond, Børre, Saara**).
    - done
* go through other directories, fix parallelity information for other documents
  (**Børre**)
    - the `sme/admin/` files are now double checked.
* gather more parallel texts (**Trond, Børre**)
    - not any more? (depends on what we are missing and how hard they are to get,
   but we will not put much time into it)
* re-analyze parallel files using the command-line version (**Saara**)
    - progressing
* when aligned, send aligned, xml `nob` texts to **Lars** (**Saara**)

## Conversion issues

Initial nbsp? Cf these:

ccat -l sme -r zcorp/bound/sme/admin/depts/ | preprocess --abbr=bin/abbr.txt --corr=src/typos.txt | lookup -flags mbTT -utf8 -f bin/missing | grep '\?' | cut -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | l

```
 19  –Danne (EM SPACE, U+2003)
 84  –Lea
 62 Bueng
```

Use UnicodeChecker to check spurious characters that look inocent (nbsp, em
space, etc).

`admin/depts` still have many errors stemming from the problematic PDF
conversion:

```
     34 kapih
     33 ttalat
```

**TODO:**
* add correction markup to the xml files (string-to-correction markup)
  (**Saara**)
* report conversion errors to **Saara** (**Trond, Steinar**)

# 6. Infrastructure

Nothing

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

Compounds with Actio as the first part. Earlier, we accepted such compounds, but 
they gave rise to so much disamb errors that we excluded them, and opted for 
lexicalisation. Now they turn up, but the solution is probably to lexicalise
them. 

```
bajásšaddaneavttuid
olgunastinlága
ávkkástallanvugiide
```

Another problem:

* we get `heajus-Oslo` instead of `heajos-Oslo`
* we get `lojis-Oslo` instead of `lojes-Oslo`
* we get `álkis-Oslo` instead of `álkes-Oslo`

The fix here is the same as for `smj` below: Hyphen must be included in the
right context triggering lowering.

Third issue: stuorra-oslolaš does not work (that is, initial lower case oslolaš
after compound with hyphen - there is always hyphen in front of name-based
words).

TODO:
* Actio compounds: The disamb crew is satisfied. Now it is up to the divvun
  folks to see whether it is too hard to lexicalise
  (**Thomas, Maaren, Steinar**)
* Lack of lowering before hyphen: Twol rewrite. (**Thomas, Trond**)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)

### Numbers:

Needs to be included in the non-rec transducers, and their inflection needs to
be tested. Test specification:

* inflection (case, number, ordinality)
* generation of higher numerals (not inflected)

TODO:
* include numbers in the non-recursive transducers (i.e. split the recursive and 
  the non-recursive part of the numerals) (**Trond, Thomas**)
* Set up test bed for numerals, test and revise (**who?**)
* Make a test bed `make num-paradigm` (**Trond**)
* Go through the Num bugs (**Trond, Thomas, Steinar**)

### Hyphenation problem

Vowel combinations that are not defined as diphthongs behave like diphthongs
anyway, ie. they don't get hyphenated. In North sámi we have this problem when
there is `a` or `u` in second position:

```
laam
laam    laam (expected: la-am)
liam
liam    liam
luam
luam    luam
lyam
lyam    lyam
lium
lium    lium
luum
luum    luum
lyum
lyum    lyum
```

For Lule sámi ALL Vowel combos behave like diphtongs.

South Sámi needs supervising, too, there are reports indicating it has onset
maximising rather than coda maximising.

TODO:

* write diphthong hyphenation pseudocode (**Thomas**)
* rewrite hyphenation code (**Trond**)
* ask Ove Lorentz to report on our sma hyphenator (**Trond**)

## Lule Sámi

We had a twol problem -- now fixed by **Thomas**. We still have a problem with
actor nouns of type `juhttsat:juhttse`: when hyphened we get
`juhttsa-muorra` instead of `juhttse-muorra`. There is a similar problem in
`sme` with adjectives (see above).

The fix is to include the hyphen in the right context triggering vowel fronting.

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* Lack of lowering/fronting before hyphen: Twol rewrite. (**Thomas, Trond**)
* include numbers in the non-recursive transducers
* Set up a test bed for numerals, test and revise (**who?**)

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

**Sjur** continued refactoring and redesign of the risten.no code: risten.no now 
has full i18n support, is using the latest Forrest to overcome several
shortcomings of the previous version, and is soon ready for a more flexible
editor.

Decided in Tromsø:
* add logging facilities to the interface
* add option to download local copies of the lexicon files directly from the db
* batch editing (change all entries in the found set), should later be enhanced
  to allow selection of exceptions (the found set minus deselected items)
* tag for excluding/including a name from certain applications
* future epxansion: choose what info to display in the single language browser
* display existing language entries when adding a new language to a record
* add editor to change single, existing entries

Details can be found in [the meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

Postponed:
* data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and the cvs repo
* new version of xml2lexc (based on ccat), should handle complex names correct:
  construct entries like we have now from the different parts of a complex name
  entry

TODO:
1. try to make a first version of xml2lexc in Perl for testing and preparation
  for the big jump (**Saara**)
    1. soon ready:-)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## Polderland data generation

**TODO:**
1. decide how to specify compounding behaviour info for the lexicon
  (**Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
1. add closed POS and clitics to PLX generation (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. add compound stems to the PLX generation (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. add derivations to the PLX generation (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. Include numerals in the speller (**Børre, Tomi**)

## Aspell

TODO when the major part of the PLX conversion is done:
* add Aspell/Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study Hunspell, perhaps also Soikko (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)

## Testing

**TODO:**
* get an Intel Mac for testing Windows spellers (**Børre, Sjur**)

## Localisation

TODO:
* send translation text to **Børre** and **Thomas** (**Sjur**)
    - done
* translate Windows installer text to `sme` and `smj` (**Børre, Thomas**)
    - **Børre** has started, **Thomas** (and perhaps **Steinar** and **Maaren**)
   will continue

# 10. Other

## Corpus contracts

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra on NoDaLi-sta (**Sjur**)

## Bug fixing

**57** open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and **23** risten.no bugs

# 11. Next meeting, closing

The next meeting is 15.1.2007, 09:00 Norwegian time.

The meeting was closed at 10:50.
