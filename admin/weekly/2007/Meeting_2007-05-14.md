# 3. Documentation

Nothing new.

The open documentation issues fall into these three categories:
* Beta documentation for testers
* Documentation for the online corpora
* General documentation improvement after Steinar's test (for open-source
  release)

TODO:
* write form to request corpus user account (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed till after the beta release
* document how to apply for access to closed corpus, and details on the corpus
  and its use in general (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed till after the beta release
* correct and improve it based on feedback from **Steinar** (**Børre**)
    - low priority
* beta documentation (see separate beta section below)

# 4. Corpus gathering

**Børre** received three books from **Jovnna-Ánde Vest**, *Árbbolaččat* 2 & 3,
*Sipirjá*. **Aage Solbakk** and **Elle-Márjá Vars** promised to look
through their computers and floppies and send us texts.

**Per-Eric** has been talking with **Olavi Korhonen**, which promised to sign
the contract, and move the issue forward (regarding his dictionary). Has also
talked to **Susanna Angeus-Kuoljok** and **Karin Tuolja** about the book
*gårnåtja*.

**Davvi Girji** would like us to contact them to bring the text licensing
forward. **Børre** and **Sjur** will do that.

TODO:
* `sme` texts: no new additions, fix corpus errors during this month
  (**Børre, Trond, Saara**)
* missing `nob` parallel texts should be added if such holes are found
  (**Børre, Trond**)
* Go through the list of missing or errouneous `nob` texts, based upon
  **Saara's** perfect list (**Børre, Trond**)
* add `sma` texts to the corpus repository (**Børre**)
* contact *Davvi Girji / Mikal Aase* (**Børre, Sjur**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## Alignment

**TODO**
* check with **Lars** when more texts are ready (**Trond**)

# 6. Infrastructure

**TODO:**
* update and fix our documentation and infrastructure as **Steinar** finds
  problem areas (**Børre**)
* fix internet setup for **Per-Eric's** satelite modem (**Sjur, Børre**)
    - this influences iChat, SEE sharing, and ARD connetions
        - did some investigation last week, waiting for an answer from the modem maker
* Add a Lule Sámi paradigm generators, and link the p-smj.en.html page
to it. (**Saara**)
* Translate the paradigm pages to Sámi, fix all the se links (**Børre, Trond**)
    - we have separate documents, but they are not translated, and not linked

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Maaren**)
    - possibly turn on free compounding as part of the PLX conversions (ie free
   compounding in the spellers, but not in the analyzers/transducers)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
    - postponed till after the public beta

## Lule Sámi

Clitics:
1.  Suggest it or not? NOT. Issue closed.
1.  Accept it or not? Issue open.
   Solution for now: Not accept it
   Solution for later, after investigating false positives: Accept it.

Anyway: we need a proper description on when -k is allowed, and then make sure it only appears there (-k is an allomorph of -ge only appearing after XXX, where XXX is possibly a vowel, but we need to investigate XXX)

Arguments AGAINST our solution:

* Spiik *Lulesamisk ordbok*:
    - heller (med negering) ge; -k; -ga; -ge; -gen,
   (ex inte -) iv; i; ij etc. ga/ ge/ gen,
* Spiik *grammar*:
    - ändelsen -k legges til ord som sluter på V, och ändelsen -ge legges till ord
   som slutar på konsonant.

If Spiik is right (i.e., if what he says is valid for  WRITTEN LANGAUGE, then we
may go for b.

This is the solution IF WE WANT -k/-ga.
 +Clt+ga:#ka   ENDLEX ;
twol rule changing ka to ga post cns and to k post vow

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* research the *–k* ending, whether it is a clitic or a regular inflection,
  and where it applies (**Per-Eric, Thomas**)

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

**TODO:**
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## OOo speller(s)

TODO after the MS Office Beta is delivered:
* add Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study the Hunspell formalism in detail (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* Manually mark test texts for typos (making them into gold standards)
  (**Steinar**)
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not)
* Conduct tests on new beta versions on the basis of the unspoiled gold standard
  documents (**whoever has time**), and fill in data from testing (the testers:
  **who?**)
* include the files already publically tested into the `prooftest` cataloge
  (**Steinar, Trond**)
* test each version before beta release

### Testing tools

**TODO:**
* document the AppleScript testing tool (**Sjur**)
* improve speller test bench (**Sjur**)
    - integrate the ccat speller testing options in the Makefile (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* ask for Linux version of the Polderland command-line speller (for victorio)
  (**Sjur**)
    - done, waiting for a price quote (it is outside the present contract)

### Regression tests

**TODO:**
* add extraction of all known spelling errors in the corpus (not the
  `prooftest` corpus), and check that they are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
* test the `typos.txt` list, and check that all entries are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
* consider how to do a regression **self-test**, ie, how to test the full
  wordlist (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - extract all the base forms in the lexicon, and run them through the speller
    - extract all SUB-marked entries, and run them through the lexicon
        - integrate these in the make file (**Sjur**)

## Localisation

We need to translate the info added to our front page (and a separate page)
regarding the beta release. Also the press release needs to be translated.

TODO:
* translate beta release docs to `sme` (**Thomas**)
* translate beta release docs to `smj` (**Thomas**)

## Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

**Børre** has been doing the whole PLX conversion process on his own computer
under Linux, skipping the gzip stage. This should speed up the process quite a
bit, but is problematic from a legal point of view. The proper solution is to
get a new license from either Polerland or Xerox that will let us run the whole
build process on one single computer, be it victorio or the G5.

Børre has been working with sme files from late april, i.e., we need (and already
got?) better routines for file input.

**TODO:**
* ask MacOffice for larger disks for the G5 (**Børre**), and report about
  possible RAM-related problems, and the warranty on the RAM.
    - done
* follow up on larger disks for victorio (**Børre, Trond**)
* follow up on newer server OS on victorio (**Børre, Trond**)
    - probably not before June, hopefully then
* ask for mklex for Linux (victorio) from Polderland (**Sjur**)
    - waiting for a price quote.
* ask Xerox for a commercial lisense for the xfst tools on the G5 (**Sjur**)

### Compounding restrictions

How to include compounding restriction comment tags in the transducers:
```
giv0ri:giv'ri ALBMI ; !+SgNomCmp +SgGenCmp +PlGenCmp
=> (using a perl script or similar)
+SgNomCmp+SgGenCmp+PlGenCmpgiv0ri:giv'ri ALBMI ; !
```

**TODO:**
1. improve prefix conversion to PLX (**Tomi**)
1. improve middle noun conversion to PLX (**Tomi**)
1. improve noun + adjective PLX conversion: (**Tomi**)
    1. compounding stems - how do we generate them? Using the java client?
    `+SgNomCmp+Cmpnd` = `sáme–`, should give the correct compounding stem,
    shouldn't it? We want to **optionally** go from: `sáme-	NLI` to
    `sáme	NL`: `-	NLI (->) 	NL`, which means we should be able to
    extract correct compounding stems using xfst methods only.
    1. compounding tags - we need to obey them when making the transducers.
    Suggestion - see above.
1. make conversion test sample; add conversion testing to the make file
  (**Tomi**)
    1. to regression test / QA the PLX conversion.
1. improve number conversion (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. ask for larger disk for the web server (**Trond, Børre**)

## Public Beta release

**TODO:**
* working and updated `smj` speller (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add numbers, compound restrictions to both spellers if time permits
  (**Børre, Tomi**)
* finish press release (**Sjur**)
* add info to front page (incl. download links) (**Børre**)
    - download page made, only needs to add the speller beta when it is ready.
* write separate page with detailed info (incl. download links) (**Børre**)
    - a separate page for the beta speller, with installation instructions, etc.
* translate press release, web pages (**Børre, Thomas, whoever**)
* collect a list of PR recipients, forward to Berit Karen Paulsen
  (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* test final beta speller installers on Windows and Mac (**Børre**)
* update installer packages with latest speller lexicon (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - we need to test the procedure, and make sure it works
