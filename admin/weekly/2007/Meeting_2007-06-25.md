# 3. Documentation

TODO:
* write form to request corpus user account (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* document how to apply for access to closed corpus, and details on the corpus
  and its use in general (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* correct and improve it based on feedback from **Steinar** (**Børre**)

# 4. Corpus gathering

**Sjur** spoke with **Solvår Knutsen** at Árran, **Per-Eric** will follow up.
Hopefully this will result in more `smj` texts this summer. **Sjur** also
discussed with **Filip Mikkelsen** about getting texts from *Bahko*, and it
is ok with them. What is left to do is to agree on the practical details.

TODO:
* `sme` texts: no new additions, fix corpus errors during this month
  (**Børre, Trond, Saara**)
* missing `nob` parallel texts should be added if such holes are found
  (**Børre, Trond**)
* Go through the list of missing or errouneous `nob` texts, based upon
  **Saara's** perfect list (**Børre, Trond**)
* add `sma` texts to the corpus repository (**Børre**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

Nothing this week either.

# 6. Infrastructure

**TODO:**
* update and fix our documentation and infrastructure as **Steinar** finds
  problem areas (**Børre**)
    - working on this one
* fix internet setup for **Per-Eric's** satelite modem (**Sjur**)
    - this influences iChat, SEE sharing, and ARD connetions

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Maaren**)
    - possibly turn on free compounding as part of the PLX conversions (ie free
   compounding in the spellers, but not in the analyzers/transducers)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
* open up compounding for all actios (**Tomi**)

### Compounding of actors and actios of transitive verbs

The following lexicons needs the specified compounding tags to be applied to all
entries:
```
LEXICON ACTORTV !+SgNomCmp +SgGenCmp +PlGenCmp +SgLeft +SgNomLeft +SgGenLeft +PlGenLeft

LEXICON BOAHTINTV  ! Long compound-forms
 +N+Sg+Nom: K ;
 +N+SgCmp: R ; !+SgCmp +SgLeft +SgNomLeft +SgGenLeft +PlGenLeft
```

## Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* `ä-æ` in speller (**Thomas, Sjur**)
* lexicalise words from the Olavi missing list, but check against the pdf
  original where in doubt (**Per-Eric**)
    - still about 2800 words to lexicalise
* add normativity issues to our normativity document (**Thomas**)
* actios of 3-syllable verbs must be checked in the next speller
    of their lexicon names. Now the names are changed, and it should be fixed
    now, needs to be tested in the new speller
* adverbs of 3-syllable adjectives must be tested in the next speller

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

**TODO:**
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## OOo spellers

**Børre, Tomi** had multiple sessions on this in Drag.

TODO:
* add Hunspell data conversion to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study the Hunspell formalism in detail (**Børre, Tomi**)

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**Sjur** added documentation about the procedure.

**TODO:**
* Manually mark test texts for typos (**Maaren, Steinar**)
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)

### Testing tools

**Sjur** is trying to get the ccat typos option integrated in the test targets
in the Makefile. Hopefully done soon.

**TODO:**
* document the AppleScript testing tool (**Sjur**)
* improve speller test bench (**Sjur**)
    - integrate the ccat speller testing options in the Makefile (**Sjur, Tomi**)
        - working on it

### Regression tests

Nothing new

**TODO:**
* add extraction of all known spelling errors in the corpus (not the
  `prooftest` corpus), and check that they are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
* test the `typos.txt` list, and check that all entries are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
* consider how to do a regression **self-test**, ie, how to test the full
  wordlist (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - extract all the base forms in the lexicon, and run them through the speller
    - extract all SUB-marked entries, and run them through the lexicon
        - integrate these in the make file (**Sjur**)

## Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

**TODO:**
* install larger disks, new RAM on the G5 when they arrive (**Børre**)
    - done
* ask for mklex for Linux (victorio) from Polderland (**Sjur**)
    - offer received
* ask Xerox for a commercial lisense for the xfst tools on the G5 (**Sjur**)
* add compounding restrictions to the PLX conversion (**Tomi**)
    - done and tested - some errors found, they're added to Bugzilla

## Public Beta follow-up

**TODO:**
* file list in Windows not complete (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - done
* test smj on typos (**Børre**)
    - tried, but got an error, thus skipped. Needs to be checked now.
    - error reported to **Saara**
        - fixed
    - smj typos tested, many errors found in the typos list itself
        - errors in the `typos.txt` should be fixed (**Per-Eric**)
    - rerun the test (**Sjur**)
* celebrate
    - done
* resend the press release to some channels in Sweden, Finland and Norway
    - Other finnish institutions to contact could be:
        - Samiradio (**Tomi**) - they're planning to make a report, have contacted
    Maaren
        - Sami parliament (**Tomi**)
        - Oulu - giellagas (**Tomi**) - talked to some people
        - Lapin yliopisto - Rantala (**Trond**)
        - Helsingin yliopisto - Seurujärvi-Kari (**Tomi**)
