# 3. Documentation

Missing documentation on corpus access: no link to unrestricted part of corpus
for download, and no page describing how to apply for access to the corpus.

TODO:
* write form to request corpus user account (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* document how to apply for access to closed corpus, and details on the corpus
  and its use in general (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* add short description on our front page on anonymous cvs and corpus access,
  with links to relevant documentation (**Børre**)

# 4. Corpus gathering

**Børre** had a short look at the new `sma` files. Nothing else happened.

TODO:
* `sme` texts: no new additions, fix corpus errors during this month
  (**Børre, Trond, Saara**)
* missing `nob` parallel texts should be added if such holes are found
  (**Børre, Trond**)
* Go through the list of missing or errouneous `nob` texts, based upon
  **Saara's** perfect list (**Børre, Trond**)
* add `sma` texts to the corpus repository (**Børre**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## Alignment

**TODO:**
* go through other directories, fix parallellity information for other documents
  (**Børre**)
    - not done
* when aligned, send aligned, xml `nob` texts to **Kristin** (**Saara**)
    - almost ready

## Conversion issues

Character encoding errors are vanishing, thanks to **Saara.** What is left as an
annoying problem is the pdf cutting of wordforms. 

```

n/depts/Mangf027.pdf.xml:    <p>Kultuvra ja dear vvašvuohta Kultuvra ja dearvvaš

idfuolahusa doaibmaplánaruđaiguin (ja mielladear vvašvuođa buoridanplánaruđaigui
                          vuhtiiváldima dárbu ár vvoštallojuvvo dan oktavuođas,

Another error type found/still not corrected:
 ánáidgárddiide, giellaoahpahussii ja diehtojuo­ hkin-, ovddidan- ja oaivadanbar
```

We have two suggestions for fixing some or most of these errors:

1. String replacement in the xsl files, like / vva/vva/ etc.
1. testing the string output of the pdf conversion in the morphological analyser:

```
- test each string returned for morphological recognisability
- if string is not recognised, and the following sting is not recognised either:
  - concatenate the to unrecognised strings, and try again
  - if the concatenation is recognised, then use the concatenated string, if
    not, leave the strings as is
```

Pro/con:

* String replacement is safe (or can be made safe, with conservative use of
  strings), but will have less coverage (leave more errors untouched)
* It is fast, and within the setup we have. On the other side, it takes some
  time to identify the files.
* morphological testing is safer, have far better error correction performeance, 
  but will be slower. It also takes some time to set up the procedure.

**TODO:**
* report conversion errors to **Saara** (**Trond, Steinar**)
* Have a look at the two suggestions for pdf mending above (**Saara**)

# 6. Infrastructure

We need to test it for new corpus users, and external users in general, cf the
e-mail announcement to the NoDaLi mailing list about to be made ready.

Test tasks:
* check out anonymous cvs, and try to build the `sme` analyzer
* download the open section of the corpus, and try to use it as input to the
  `sme` disambiguator
* try to apply for a corpus user account, and when the account is created, try
  to use it to analyze some closed parts of the corpus

Instructions:
* only the ones on our web site - no interference from Børre, Trond or others:-)
* as soon as you hit a road block, write down the problem as detailed as
  possible, **then** go and ask for help, or wait until the problem has been
  fixed

**TODO:**
* test our infrastructure and documentation - follow the documentation exactly,
  and find problem areas - report problems to **Børre**. Start: At the front
  page. (**Steinar**)
* update and fix our documentation and infrastructure as **Steinar** finds
  problem areas (**Børre**)

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Thomas, Maaren, Steinar**)
* Lack of lowering before hyphen: Twol rewrite. (**Thomas, Trond**)
    - done
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)

### Numbers:

We had a meeting last Friday, memo to be found
[here](/lang/sme/Numerals.html)

TODO:
* discontinous case inflection (but only for maximally three-part compound
  numerals) (`viđain/goalmmát/logiin` and `guvttiin/logiin/viđain`)
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* produce correct number base forms in the analyzer (**Thomas, Trond**)
* include numbers in the non-recursive transducers (i.e. split the recursive and 
  the non-recursive part of the numerals) (**Trond, Thomas**)
    - done
* Set up test bed for numerals, test and revise (**who?**)
    - test bed ready - **Trond** did it
* Make a test bed `make num-paradigm` (**Trond**)
    - done
* Go through the Num bugs (**Trond, Thomas, Steinar**)
* Preprocessing of ordinals at the end of sentences - reported as bug #368.
  (**Trond**)
    - discussed

Classification of compounding with numerals:

```
Num N   ok golbmafanas
N   Num R not fanasgolbma
```

`Num Num` is a restricted type of compounding, very different from free
compounding. `Num Num` is also already implemented in the transducer, but left
out, due to circularity.

Written long numerals are marginal, we may consider generating some. Syntax:

```
* 1-9 + thousand + 1-9 + hundred +
    { 1-9 + ten +  1-9 / 1-9 + teen / 1-9 twenty + 1-9 }
```

From our corpus:

```
      1 golmma#beaivásaš
     10 golmma#geardán
      2 golmma#geardásaš
     20 golmma#gielat
      6 golmma#jagáš
      3 golmma#jahkásaš
      1 golmma#jienat
      1 golmma#juvllat
      1 golmma#lanjat
      7 golmma#lágan
      3 golmma#oasat
      2 golmma#oktasaš
      6 golmma#riika
      5 golmma#čiegat
```

### Hyphenation problem

TODO:

* ask Ove Lorentz to report on our `sma` hyphenator (**Trond**)
    - Still waiting for an answer

## Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* Lack of lowering/fronting before hyphen: Twol rewrite. (**Thomas, Trond**)
* include numbers in the non-recursive transducers (**Thomas, Trond**)
    - done
* Set up a test bed for numerals, test and revise (**Trond**)

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [the meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

Postponed:
* data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and the cvs repo

TODO:
1. restructure interface code for easier maintenance, coding and use
    1. well under way, still some work
        1. continued
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## Polderland data generation

PLX conversion made substantial progress, and we now cover most POSes, with the
exception of numerals. Also derivations are still not covered. We now need to
send off what we have to Polderland, to let them test what we have, and deliver
a first version of the spellers based on PLX code from us.

Prefixes should be added as separate entries.

**TODO:**
1. add closed POS and clitics to PLX generation (**Børre, Tomi**)
    1. done
1. add compound stems to the PLX generation (**Børre, Tomi**)
    1. done
1. Include numerals in the speller (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. add prefixes to the PLX (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. add `smj` to PLX conversion (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. add derivations to the PLX generation (**Børre, Tomi**)

## Aspell

TODO when the major part of the PLX conversion is done:
* add Aspell/Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study Hunspell, perhaps also Soikko (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)

## Testing

**TODO:**
* get an Intel Mac for testing Windows spellers (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - **Sjur** has asked **Børre** to order two new MBP

## Localisation

`smj` is now translated, and should be sent to Polderland.

TODO:
* translate Windows installer text to `sme` and `smj` (**Børre, Thomas**)
    - `smj` done
* send `smj` translations to Polderland (**Børre**)

# 10. Other

## Corpus contracts

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra on NoDaLi-sta (**Sjur**)
    - wrote most of the letters, but found some holes (discussed above)

## Bug fixing

**55** open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and **23** risten.no bugs

# 11. Next meeting, closing

The next meeting is 29.1.2007, 09:30 Norwegian time.
