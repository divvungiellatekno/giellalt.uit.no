# 3. Documentation

TODO:
* write form to request corpus user account (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* document how to apply for access to closed corpus, and details on the corpus
  and its use in general (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* correct and improve it based on feedback from **Steinar** (**Børre**)

# 4. Corpus gathering

**Sjur** spoke to Davvi Girji, we will send them a list of the authors contacted
and DG will send a list of all works DG has published - ever (not all of them
available in digital form, though)!

TODO:
* `sme` texts: no new additions, fix corpus errors during this month
  (**Børre, Trond, Saara**)
* missing `nob` parallel texts should be added if such holes are found
  (**Børre, Trond**)
* Go through the list of missing or errouneous `nob` texts, based upon
  **Saara's** perfect list (**Børre, Trond**)
* add `sma` texts to the corpus repository (**Børre**)
* contact *Davvi Girji / Mikal Aase* (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - done

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

Nothing this week either.

# 6. Infrastructure

**TODO:**
* update and fix our documentation and infrastructure as **Steinar** finds
  problem areas (**Børre**)
    - working on this one
* fix internet setup for **Per-Eric's** satelite modem (**Sjur, Børre**)
    - this influences iChat, SEE sharing, and ARD connetions

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

Actio compounds: **Maaren** and **Duomma** disagrees about what is correct and
not, needs to be resolved. We need some more clarifications about the system,
which we will do in Drag.

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Maaren**)
    - vuolgin- and vuolgga- , both are okei vuolggasadji and vuolgindássi for eks
    - possibly turn on free compounding as part of the PLX conversions (ie free
   compounding in the spellers, but not in the analyzers/transducers)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
* open up compounding for all actios (**Tomi**)

## Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* `ö/ä` vs `ø/æ` in speller (**Thomas, Sjur**)
* lexicalise words from the Olavi missing list, but check against the pdf
  original where in doubt (**Inga**)
* add normativity issues to our normativity document (**Inga, Thomas**)
* investigate why actios of 3-syllable verbs are not accepted by the speller
  (**Thomas**)
    - norm-lookup does not see these, ordinary look-up sees
        - these were grepped out because they containted the string `SUB` as part
    of their lexicon names. Now the names are changed, and it should be fixed
    now, needs to be tested in the new speller
* investigate why some adverbs of 3-syllable adjectives are not accepted by the
  speller (**Thomas**)
    - norm-look-up sees some, but not all, ordinary look-up sees
        - it seems to be fixed, needs to be tested in the new speller

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

**TODO:**
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## OOo spellers

**Børre, Sjur, Tomi** will have a session on this in Drag.

TODO:
* add Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study the Hunspell formalism in detail (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

Text in other languages should not be marked as spelling errors.

**TODO:**
* Manually mark test texts for typos (making them into gold standards)
  (**Steinar**)
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)

### Testing tools

**Sjur** is trying to get the ccat typos option integrated in the test targets
in the Makefile. Hopefully done soon.

**TODO:**
* document the AppleScript testing tool (**Sjur**)
* improve speller test bench (**Sjur**)
    - integrate the ccat speller testing options in the Makefile (**Sjur, Tomi**)
        - working

### Regression tests

Nothing new

**TODO:**
* add extraction of all known spelling errors in the corpus (not the
  `prooftest` corpus), and check that they are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
* test the `typos.txt` list, and check that all entries are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
* consider how to do a regression **self-test**, ie, how to test the full
  wordlist (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - extract all the base forms in the lexicon, and run them through the speller
    - extract all SUB-marked entries, and run them through the lexicon
        - integrate these in the make file (**Sjur**)

## Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

**TODO:**
* install larger disks, new RAM on the G5 when they arrive (**Børre**)
    - received, will be installed soon.
* ask for mklex for Linux (victorio) from Polderland (**Sjur**)
    - waiting for the offer
* ask Xerox for a commercial lisense for the xfst tools on the G5 (**Sjur**)
* add compounding restrictions to the PLX conversion (**Tomi**)
    - done, seems correct, but needs more testing when a new speller is ready.

### Compounding restrictions

Compounding restrictions are now integrated in the PLX conversion, thanks to
**Tomi**.

**TODO:**
1. improve prefix conversion to PLX (**Tomi**)
    1. done
1. improve middle noun conversion to PLX (**Tomi**)
    1. done
1. improve noun + adjective PLX conversion: (**Tomi**)
    1. compounding stems - how do we generate them? Using the java client?
    `+SgNomCmp+Cmpnd` = `sáme–`, should give the correct compounding stem,
    shouldn't it? We want to **optionally** go from: `sáme-	NLI` to
    `sáme	NL`: `-	NLI (->) 	NL`, which means we should be able to
    extract correct compounding stems using xfst methods only.
        1. done
    1. compounding tags - we need to obey them when making the transducers. 
    Suggestion - see above.
        1. done
1. make conversion test sample; add conversion testing to the make file
  (**Tomi**)
    1. to regression test / QA the PLX conversion.
        1. not done

## Public Beta follow-up

**TODO:**
* fix clitics (**Tomi**)
    - done after the release, has to be tested
        - can be tested in the small speller - tested,
    all accepted: `Sjurgo buorrege Trosterutge biilago`
* file list in Windows not complete (**Børre, Sjur**)
* test smj on typos (**Børre**)
    - tried, but got an error, thus skipped. Needs to be checked now.
        - error reported to **Saara**
* celebrate
    - NOT done - will do in Drag:)
* resend the press release to some channels in Sweden, Finland and Norway
  (**Sjur**)
    - **Per-Eric** will follow up in Sweden, **Tomi** in Finland, to make sure we
   have got reasonable coverage, or at least enough users for the beta spellers.
   [Finnish press coverage](http://www.lapinkansa.fi/uutiset/ulkomaat/142.shtml).
   Other finnish institutions to contact could be:
        - Samiradio (**Tomi**) - they're planning to make a report
        - Sami parliament (**Tomi**)
        - Oulu - giellagas (**Tomi**)
        - Lapin yliopisto - Rantala (**Trond**)
        - Helsingin yliopisto - Seurujärvi-Kari (**Tomi**)
        - KOTUS (**Sjur**)
        - Citysaamit (**Tomi**)
        - Oulun saamelaiset (**Tomi**)
* move list of known errors to Bugzilla (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - done
