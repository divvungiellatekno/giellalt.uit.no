!!!3. Documentation

Bugzilla 3.0.x has some nice features we would like to use, like shared,
filtered queries.

__TODO:__
* add semi-automatic updates of fixed and open issues to README files
  (__Sjur__)
** done
* update Bugzilla (__Børre__)


!!!4. Corpus gathering

__Trond__ had a look at the {{sma}} bible texts. We will postpone adding them
till after Christmas, when we hopefully will have a dedicated {{sma}} project.

__Børre__ has received lots of texts from __Torkel Rasmussen__, they will 
be added this week.

__TODO:__
* test correct-type markup with latest enhancements (__Sjur__)
* add texts from __Torkel Rasmussen__ (__Børre__)


!!!5. Corpus infrastructure

Nothing.

!!!6. Infrastructure

Speller testing is still fluctuating a bit.

!!!7. Linguistics

!!North Sámi

{{{
Čorru > čorut
*Oslolaš with hyphen required, is printed now, but shouldn't
oslolaš - is done correctly now
}}}

This one is fixed by the latest changes in the PLX conversion.

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: ''vuolggasadji''  vs. ''vuolginsadji''
  (__Maaren__)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case {{o}} (__Tomi__)
** fixed



!!Lule Sámi

We have the same oslolaš derivation in {{smj}} too, but with another derivation.

{{{
Tjårro > tjårok
*Oslolaš with hyphen required, is printed now, but shouldn't
oslolaš - is done correctly now
}}}

Correct compounds are still not recognised:
{{{
Stuorafuoskok => input, should be accepted
(218) Stuorauvsuk
(217) Stuorraluohkák
}}}

fuoskok
fuoskok Fuossko+N+Prop+Plc+Sg+Gen+Der1+Der/k+N+Sg+Nom

{{{
StuorFuoskok	Stuorafuoskok	2
(220) Stuorruskak
(220) Stuoruduskak
(219) SUFUR-Fuoskok
}}}

''Fuoskok'' is in the PLX lexicon, but does ''not'' take part in this type of
compounding. It should actually have been ''fuoskok''.

Fuoskok Fuossko+N+Prop+Plc+Pl+Nom+Clt+ge
Fuoskok Fuossko+N+Prop+Plc+Sg+Gen+Clt+ge

smj propernoun bug issue:
procedure
# convert from common base (which means sme base)
## Words not convertable should be added to separate smj lexicon, and words that
   should not be converted from sme sme should be moved to non-convert lexicon
   in sme???
# send to {{smj}} morphology


The original todo was to correct the smj morphology.
Current test shows weaknesses in both camps:
* conversion errors
* words that should not have been converten
* missing smj-unique names
* errors in the morphology


Testing procedures: 
* analyse baseforms (as for sme)
* generate a couple of caseforms from  the baseforms, and inspect result


Suggestion:
Let us first analyse the proper noun base forms for Lule Sámi, and thereafter
look at the morphology.

TODO:
* refine {{smj}} proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (__Thomas__)
** it is only about adding {{smj}} names now, working on it
* lexicalise words from the Olavi missing list, but check against the pdf
  original where in doubt (__Per-Eric__)
** working on it
* add {{oslolaš}} type derivation test cases to the regresssion file
  (__Thomas__)
** done
* {{sme->smj}} lexicon conversion to build bilingual lexicon resources, and
  increase {{smj}} coverage (__Trond, Thomas, Svenne__)
** working on it
* add proper nouns (__Thomas, Ilona__)


!!!8. Name lexicon infrastructure

This sub-project needs to get up and running soon. Mainly __Sjur's__ task.

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

__TODO:__
# fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (__Saara__)
# finish first version of the editing (__Sjur__)
# test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (__Sjur, Thomas, Trond__)
# make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (__Sjur, Saara__)
# convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (__Sjur, Tomi, Saara__)
# implement data synchronisation between [risten.no|http://www.risten.no] and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
# start to use the xml file as source file
# clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (__Thomas, Maaren, linguists__)
# merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (__linguists__)
# publish the name lexicon on risten.no (__Sjur__)
# add missing parallel names for placenames (__linguists__)
# add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (__linguists__)


!!!9. Proofing tools

!!Hunspell

Sami languages are not supported in OpenOffice.org, until that is fixed we will
have to do the same tricks we apply in Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac.

TODO:
* Hunspell lexicon conversion (__Tomi, Børre__)
* Begin adding support for the sami languages in OpenOffice.org (__Børre__)


!!Testing

!Spelling Error Markup

__TODO:__
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (__Saara__)
* move __Steinar's__ error markup in the xml files to (a copy of) the original
  (__Børre, Kimme__)



!Automated testing

The infrastructure is about to settle. 

__TODO:__
* document the AppleScript testing tool (__Sjur__)
* document the testing procedures (__Sjur__)


!!Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

__TODO:__
* fix {{oslolaš}} bug (__Tomi__)
** fixed for {{sme}}, still open for {{smj}}

!!InDesign tools

We have received the first hyphenation beta for InDesign. It has been tested,
and seems to work fine.

We should give the beta to __Min Áigi__ and __Davvi Girji__.

__TODO:__
* make available InDesign hyphenator to __Min Áigi/Davvi Girji__ (__Sjur__)
* document the InDesign tools (__Sjur__)
* add hyphenation testing (__Sjur__)


!!Hyphenators

There are some hyphenation errors we need to debug.

__TODO:__

__TODO:__
* collect/build an e-mail notify list; we make it simple, a text document with
  e-mail addresses (__Sjur, Børre, others__)
** done
* update list of fixed and known issues - Tuesday afternoon (__Sjur, Risten__)
** done
* update translations of README-files - Thursday afternoon
  (__Risten, Thomas, Sjur, Trond__)
** done
* update installation packages (__Sjur__)
** done
* announce the beta (__Sjur__)
** today


!!Release version

The CD cover etc. will be worked on by John-Marcus Kuhmunen, and will follow the
SD design rules. He is now waiting for the text to be put on the CD cover and
other places.

__TODO:__
* write text to go on the CD cover (__Risten__)
* set up CD-printing printer (__Risten__)



!!!10. Other


!!Corpus contracts

Delayed till after final release.

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra as open-source on NoDaLi-sta
  (__Sjur__)


!!Bug fixing

When fixing bugs, record the version number containing the fix in the Bugzilla
bug report, such that for each bug, we know exactly when it should have been
fixed, in what file(s) and what version.

__59__ open Divvun/Disamb bugs (__26__ of these 56 are speller-related bugs,
__33__ are other bugs), and __23__ risten.no bugs
