# 3. Documentation

Nothing this week.

# 4. Corpus gathering

**Trond** finally got the `sma` texts from Snåsa, quite a lot of text, but not
all. **Børre** will add it to the corpus repository.

The relevant persons have worked on the tasks below.

TODO:
* `sme` texts: no new additions, fix corpus errors during this month
  (**Børre, Trond, Saara**)
* missing `nob` parallel texts should be added if such wholes are found
  (**Børre, Trond**)
* Go through the list of missing or errouneous nob texts, based upon Saaras
  perfect list (**Børre, Trond**)
* add `sma` texts to the corpus repository (**Børre**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

**Lars Nygård** has left UiO. **Anders Nøklestad** is back in his old position.
For us, this means that **Anders** will be the person to contact for technical
matters, and **Kristin Hagen** the one for parsing of the `nob` parallel
texts.

## Alignment

**TODO:**
* go through other directories, fix parallelity information for other documents
  (**Børre**)
    - Still to be done.
* re-analyze parallel files using the command-line version (**Saara**)
    - done all existing files
* when aligned, send aligned, xml `nob` texts to **Kristin** (**Saara**)
    - not yet done

## Conversion issues

**TODO:**
* add correction markup to the xml files (string-to-correction markup)
  (**Saara**)
    - see news discussion - we will and should allow text corrections concerning
   character encoding problems.
* report conversion errors to **Saara** (**Trond, Steinar**)
    - Not done.

# 6. Infrastructure

Nothing this week.

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Thomas, Maaren, Steinar**)
* Lack of lowering before hyphen: Twol rewrite. (**Thomas, Trond**)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)

### Numbers:

One problem we have is to correctly identify base forms of numerals, cf:
(the baseform of 16 is given as 6)

```
guhttanuppelohkái
guhttanuppelohkái       guhtta+Num+Sg+Nom
guhttanuppelohkái       guhtta+Num+Sg+Acc
```

TODO:
* discontinous case inflection (but only for maximally three-part compound
  numerals) (`viđain/goalmmát/logiin` and `guvttiin/logiin/viđain`)
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* produce correct base forms in the analyzer (**Thomas, Trond**)
* include numbers in the non-recursive transducers (i.e. split the recursive and
  the non-recursive part of the numerals) (**Trond, Thomas**)
* Set up test bed for numerals, test and revise (**who?**)
* Make a test bed `make num-paradigm` (**Trond**)
* Go through the Num bugs (**Trond, Thomas, Steinar**)
* Preprocessing of ordinals at the end of sentences - reported as bug #368.
  (**Trond**)

### Hyphenation problem

TODO:

* write diphthong hyphenation pseudocode (**Thomas**)
    - done for both `sme` and `smj`
* rewrite hyphenation code (**Trond**)
    - done for both `sme` and `smj`
* ask Ove Lorentz to report on our `sma` hyphenator (**Trond**)
    - Not done.

## Lule Sámi

It could actually be that the `smj` numerals are not recursive. They were made
differently from the `sme` ones, since Spiik reported them as written sepa-
rately.

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* Lack of lowering/fronting before hyphen: Twol rewrite. (**Thomas, Trond**)
* include numbers in the non-recursive transducers
* Set up a test bed for numerals, test and revise (**who?**)

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [the meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

Postponed:
* data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and the cvs repo

TODO:
1. try to make a first version of xml2lexc in Perl for testing and preparation
  for the big jump (**Saara**)
    1. done
1. restructure interface code for easier maintenance, coding and use
    1. well under way, still some work
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## Polderland data generation

There is now a decision on compound parts, and compounding can now be
included in the PLX generation. Compounding is a sine qua non (a must) for the
beta version. The specification is found in
[this document.](/lang/common/CompoundTags.html)

We have a UTF-8 problem with the paradigm server in some cases, some characters
are returned as Latin1. When the server runs on G5, everything works fine. But
when it is run on victorio, some conversion errors turn up. The problem may be
Java-related, according to some net sources, and also with the perl settings in
victorio, related to the change in perl setup.

Suggestion: Just use the G5, and not victorio, since there is no time to fix the
setup in victorio (the real error).

**TODO:**
1. decide how to specify compounding behaviour info for the lexicon
  (**Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
    1. Done!
1. add closed POS and clitics to PLX generation (**Børre, Tomi**)
    1. Progressing.
1. add compound stems to the PLX generation (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. add derivations to the PLX generation (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. Include numerals in the speller (**Børre, Tomi**)

## Aspell

TODO when the major part of the PLX conversion is done:
* add Aspell/Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study Hunspell, perhaps also Soikko (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)

## Testing

**TODO:**
* get an Intel Mac for testing Windows spellers (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - nothing yet

## Localisation

TODO:
* translate Windows installer text to `sme` and `smj` (**Børre, Thomas**)
    - progressing (smj is mostly done, lots lacking in sme)

# 10. Other

## Corpus contracts

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra on NoDaLi-sta (**Sjur**)
    - not done

## Bug fixing

**56** open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and **23** risten.no bugs

# 11. Next meeting, closing

The next meeting is 22.1.2007, 09:30 Norwegian time.

The meeting was closed at 10:44.
