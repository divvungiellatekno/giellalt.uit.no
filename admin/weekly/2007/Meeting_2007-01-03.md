    - Done some work on bugs, closed a couple.

# 3. Documentation

TODO:
* either fix forrest installations (**Sjur**), or create a new tarball
  (**Børre**)
* cvs up of the public server should be done for `xtdoc/sd/documentation/`
  - notice the directory! (**Børre**)
* update setup and installation instructions (**Børre**)

# 4. Corpus gathering

We should probably concentrate upon mending what we have, up to Febrary 8th.

**Børre** has been fixing the meta information for many files, adding info on parallel language versions.

TODO:
* `sme` texts: Fix what we have for this month (**Børre, Trond, Saara**)
* missing `nob` parallel texts could be an issue (**Børre, Trond**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## Aligner

The command line aligner is in place, and most(?)/all(?) potential texts are
aligned.

**TODO:**
* make an overview of status quo (**Trond, Børre, Saara**). **Børre** has added
  parallellity status to all `admin/sd/` texts
* gather more parallel texts (**Trond, Børre**)
    - not any more? (depends on what we are missing and how hard they are to get,
   but we will not put much time into it)
* re-analyze parallel files using the command-line version (**Saara**)
    - progressing
* when aligned, send aligned, xml `nob` texts to **Lars** (**Saara**)

## Conversion issues

Analysis statistics:

```
	words	missing	% recognised
adm	1493746	28967	98,06
bib	241233	2651	98,90
fac	382353	11371	97,03
fic	70601	7847	88,89
law	284700	6269	97,80
new	4032848	17134	99,58
```

There are still a lot of conversion errors, and fixing them should be a priority
this month. Error types:

* pdf files (there will always be some errors here)
* string-string replacement during the xsl conversion
    - Conversion errors (but we want to fix the conversion)
    - typos (should be marked up using our error markup tags)
    - grammatical errors (as above)

So far, we only have had character replacement (even context-less character
replacement). We can use XSL string replacement to correct spelling errors to
constructs like, cf the `corpus.dtd` and [a previous meeting memo
| https://giellalt.uit.no/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-20.html#Correction+tags%3F]:

```
<error correct="corrected text">erroneous text</error>
```

Either we use the function **Trond** found, or we install and use Saxon 8 and
XSL 2, which have good string manipulation tools.

Flow:
* orig
* xsl
    - corr-of-textstring (not implemented yet) (we is > we are) (we keep the
   orig text, and the correction is added as additional info in an attribute,
   see above)
* xml
* preprocess
* corr-of-token=typos.txt eror>error
* analysis

Do we have good tools for localising conversion errors? Problem: I spot an error
in the analysis. Which file is it in?
`ccat` removes file source info, and we are thus in the blind. Conclusion: we
don't have a good tool for this, only grep.

**TODO:**
* add correction markup to the xml files (string-to-correction markup)
  (**Saara**)
* report conversion errors to **Saara** (**Trond, Steinar**)

# 6. Infrastructure

## Xerox tools wrapped as servers

**TODO:**
* find a way of integrating `vislcg` as a server, or send a feature request
  to the `vislcg` developers (**Saara**)
    - move this to Bugzilla
        - done

# 7. Linguistics

## Names and multilinguality

TODO:
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## North Sámi

TODO:
* go through the class of GAHPIR words, and try to generalise the compounding
  behaviour (**Thomas**)
    - done
* change whatever is needed based on the above generalisation
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
    - done

## Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
    - progressing - good!
* update proper noun lexicon with copy of `sme` lexicon  (**Trond**)
    - done

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decided in Tromsø:
* add logging facilities to the interface
* add option to download local copies of the lexicon files directly from the db
* batch editing (change all entries in the found set), should later be enhanced
  to allow selection of exceptions (the found set minus deselected items)
* tag for excluding/including a name from certain applications
* future epxansion: choose what info to display in the single language browser
* display existing language entries when adding a new language to a record
* add editor to change single, existing entries

Details can be found in [the meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

TODO:
* develop the needed XQueries and UI (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* try to make a first version of xml2lexc in Perl for testing and preparation
  for the big jump (**Saara**)

Postponed:
* data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and the cvs repo
* new version of xml2lexc (based on ccat), should handle complex names correct:
  construct entries like we have now from the different parts of a complex name
  entry

# 9. Spellers

## Polderland data generation

**TODO:**
* decide how to specify compounding behaviour info for the lexicon
  (**Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
    - partially done - compound stem specification still open
* add closed POS and clitics to PLX generation (**Tomi**)
* add derivations to the PLX generation (**Tomi**)
* add compound stems to the PLX generation (**Tomi**)

## Aspell

TODO when the major part of the PLX conversion is done:
* add Aspell/Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study Hunspell, perhaps also Soikko (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)

## Testing

**TODO:**
* get an Intel Mac for testing Windows spellers (**Børre, Sjur**)

## Localisation

The Windows installer should be localised. We have received the string file from
Polderland, now they should be translated.

The Mac installer they use is the standard MacOS X installer, and as `sme`
isn't generally turned on as a UI language in MacOS X, there is no big point in
translating it. It could be done, though:-)

TODO:
* send translation text to **Børre** and **Thomas** (**Sjur**)
* translate Windows installer to `sme` and `smj` (**Børre, Thomas**)

# 10. Other

## Corpus contracts

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra on NoDaLi-sta (**Sjur**)
    - still not done

## Bug fixing

**55** open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and **23** risten.no bugs

Guess: 1/3 of the bugs are fixed already (?)

# 11. Next meeting, closing

The next meeting is 8.1.2007, 09:00 Norwegian time.

The meeting was closed at 12:12.
