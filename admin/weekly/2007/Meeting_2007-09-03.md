# 3. Documentation

User documents, specifically the README files, need to get some semi-automatic
updates of the list of fixed and outstanding bugs. Should be extracted from
Bugzilla.

**TODO:**
* add semi-automatic updates of fixed and open issues to README files
  (**Børre**)

# 4. Corpus gathering

No news.

**TODO:**
* add `sma` Bible texts to the corpus repository (**Trond**)
* bug **Kåre Tjikkom** about the `smj` correct document (**Sjur**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

UiT is participating in work to get a large European infrastructure project. Our work on corpus infrastructure will constitute an important cornerstone in the Tromsø work.

# 6. Infrastructure

Nothing new - the Divvun site needs regular restarts, but this is well known.

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

(New) place names should be outfitted with a country code as a comment:

```
Ávvil ANAR ; !FIN
```

This !FIN has been added to the base list **Ilona** is working with. Quick and
easy!

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Maaren**)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
* fix twol bug (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
    - meet online this week - Thursday around 9 AM Norwegian time
* add the `sme` place names from Finland (**Ilona**)

## Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* `ä/æ` in speller, see bug report #411 (**Tomi, Sjur**)
* lexicalise words from the Olavi missing list, but check against the pdf
  original where in doubt (**Per-Eric**)
    - working on it - just over 1000 words left
* add compounding tags to:
    - nouns (**Thomas**)
        - soon finished
    - adjs (**Per-Eric**)
        - soon finished

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

This sub-project needs to get up and running soon. Mainly **Sjur's** task.

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

**TODO:**
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

New spellers released today (they accept **giella-** but suggest **giella--**).

## OOo spellers

A first codebase for Hunspell conversion commited today. Roughly 1 week, maximum
2 weeks, left until Alpha version.

TODO:
* add Hunspell data conversion (**Tomi**)
    - progressing

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)
* move **Steinar's** error markup in the xml files to (a copy of) the original
  (**Børre**)

### Automated testing

**TODO:**
* document the AppleScript testing tool (**Sjur**)
    - not finished
* improve speller test bench (**Sjur**)
    - create a speller preprocessor (**Børre** or **Sjur**)
        - **Saara** did this
    - integrate the `ccat` speller testing options in the Makefile (**Sjur**)
        - done
    - test also the correct column of the typos.txt files - now many correct words
   are not recognised by the speller (**Sjur**)
        - done

## Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

**TODO:**
* fix bug 484 (**Tomi**)
* fix bug 458 (**Trond, Sjur, Tomi**)

## New public beta

Delayed till the majority of the present bugs are fixed. The twolc bug 
is the major stopper, as well as 484 and 458.

# 10. Other

## Corpus contracts

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra as open-source on NoDaLi-sta
  (**Sjur**)

## Bug fixing

When fixing bugs, record the version number containing the fix in the Bugzilla
bug report, such that for each bug, we know exactly when it should have been
fixed, in what file(s) and what version.

**55** open Divvun/Disamb bugs (**24** of these 56 are speller-related bugs,
**28** are general bugs), and **23** risten.no bugs

## Project meeting

We'll meet in September, 24-28, in Tromsø to work on the hardest remaining
issues.

# 11. Next meeting, closing

The next meeting is 10.9.2007, 09:30 Norwegian time.
