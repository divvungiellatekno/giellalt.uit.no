!!!3. Documentation

The open documentation issues fall into these three categories:
* Beta documentation for testers
* Documentation for the online corpora
* General documentation improvement after Steinar's test (for open-source
  release)


TODO:
* write form to request corpus user account (__Børre, Sjur, Trond__)
** delayed till after the beta release
* document how to apply for access to closed corpus, and details on the corpus
  and its use in general (__Børre, Sjur, Trond__)
** delayed till after the beta release
* correct and improve it based on feedback from __Steinar__ (__Børre__)
** low priority
* beta documentation (see separate beta section below)



!!!4. Corpus gathering

TODO:
* {{sme}} texts: no new additions, fix corpus errors during this month
  (__Børre, Trond, Saara__)
* missing {{nob}} parallel texts should be added if such holes are found
  (__Børre, Trond__)
* Go through the list of missing or errouneous {{nob}} texts, based upon
  __Saara's__ perfect list (__Børre, Trond__)
* add {{sma}} texts to the corpus repository (__Børre__)
* contact ''Davvi Girji / Mikal Aase'' (__Børre, Sjur__)



!!!5. Corpus infrastructure

!!Access to licensed texts

We have four novels in our corpus, three of them will soon be added to the web
interface. Could they be added using the present, free-access web interface
(which only gives access to hit words with context, at most three sentences), or
should we have a password-protected version of the web interface to allow access
to these documents?

The present limitation of maximum three sentences at a time should be enough to
stop all but the most dedicated attempts at misuse - and such dedicated attempts
can not be stopped anyway, but should be handed over to the police if they
happen. Thus, it should be ok to allow search access to the novels using the
present, open web interface, ie without a user name and password.

__Update:__  the web interface has been changed to always require registration
before use, and usage requires a user name and password, thus all use can be
logged, and mis-use can be better traced. The only thing required
to get a username is to fill in a simple web form, accessible at
[http://omilia.uio.no/swamp/index.php?main=sami]. The corpus itself is, as
before, available at
[http://omilia.uio.no/glossa/html/index_dev.php?corpus=samno].

!!Alignment

__TODO__
* check with __Lars__ when more texts are ready (__Trond__)


!!!6. Infrastructure

__TODO:__
* update and fix our documentation and infrastructure as __Steinar__ finds
  problem areas (__Børre__)
* fix internet setup for __Per-Eric's__ satelite modem (__Sjur, Børre__)
** this influences iChat, SEE sharing, and ARD connetions
*** did some investigation last week, waiting for an answer from the modem maker
* Add a Lule Sámi paradigm generators, and link the p-smj.en.html page to it.
  (__Saara__)
** done
* Translate the paradigm pages to Sámi, fix all the {{se}} links
  (__Børre, Trond__)
** we have separate documents, but they are not translated, and not linked
*** __Saara__ has updated much of the infra for this, with better support for
    all the tools, and properly localised pages.



!!!7. Linguistics

!!North Sámi

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: ''vuolggasadji''  vs. ''vuolginsadji''
  (__Maaren__)
** possibly turn on free compounding as part of the PLX conversions (ie free
   compounding in the spellers, but not in the analyzers/transducers)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case {{o}} (__Sjur, Thomas, Trond__)
** postponed till after the public beta


!!Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine {{smj}} proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (__Thomas, Trond__)
* research the ''–k'' ending, whether it is a clitic or a regular inflection,
  and where it applies (__Per-Eric, Thomas__)
** it is a clitic, an allomorphic variant of -ge (after vowels). The variation
   should be handled by two-level rules. The clitic thus needs to be generated
   as part of the regular PLX conversion (for spellers).
* write two-level rules to handle -ge/-k clitic alternation (__Thomas__)



!!!8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

__TODO:__
# fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (__Saara__)
# finish first version of the editing (__Sjur__)
# test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (__Sjur, Thomas, Trond__)
# make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (__Sjur, Saara__)
# convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (__Sjur, Tomi, Saara__)
# implement data synchronisation between [risten.no|http://www.risten.no] and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
# start to use the xml file as source file
# clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (__Thomas, Maaren, linguists__)
# merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (__linguists__)
# publish the name lexicon on risten.no (__Sjur__)
# add missing parallel names for placenames (__linguists__)
# add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (__linguists__)


!!!9. Spellers

!!OOo speller(s)

TODO after the MS Office Beta is delivered:
* add Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (__Tomi__ - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study the Hunspell formalism in detail (__Børre, Sjur, Tomi__)


!!Testing

!Spelling Error Markup

__TODO:__
* Manually mark test texts for typos (making them into gold standards)
  (__Steinar__)
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not)
* Conduct tests on new beta versions on the basis of the unspoiled gold standard
  documents (__whoever has time__), and fill in data from testing (the testers: 
  __who?__)
* include the files already publically tested into the {{prooftest}} cataloge
  (__Steinar, Trond__)
* test each version before beta release


!Testing tools

__TODO:__
* document the AppleScript testing tool (__Sjur__)
* improve speller test bench (__Sjur__)
** integrate the ccat speller testing options in the Makefile (__Sjur, Tomi__)
* ask for Linux version of the Polderland command-line speller (for victorio)
  (__Sjur__)
** done, waiting for a price quote (it is outside the present contract)


!Regression tests

__TODO:__
* add extraction of all known spelling errors in the corpus (not the
  {{prooftest}} corpus), and check that they are properly corrected
  (__Børre, Sjur__)
* test the {{typos.txt}} list, and check that all entries are properly corrected
  (__Børre, Sjur__)
* consider how to do a regression __self-test__, ie, how to test the full
  wordlist (__Børre, Sjur__)
** extract all the base forms in the lexicon, and run them through the speller
** extract all SUB-marked entries, and run them through the lexicon
*** integrate these in the make file (__Sjur__)



!!Localisation

We need to translate the info added to our front page (and a separate page)
regarding the beta release. Also the press release needs to be translated.

TODO:
* translate beta release docs to {{sme}} (__Thomas__)
* translate beta release docs to {{smj}} (__Thomas__)



!!Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

It is now going pretty well, but we still need to transfer the files from
victorio to a Mac with Polderlands {{mklexSami*}} tools. __Børre__ is regularly
updating the spellers.

__TODO:__
* install larger disks, new RAM on the G5 when they arrive (__Børre__)
* ask for mklex for Linux (victorio) from Polderland (__Sjur__)
** waiting for a price quote.
* ask Xerox for a commercial lisense for the xfst tools on the G5 (__Sjur__)
** not done
* add compounding restrictions to the PLX convertion (__Tomi__)



!Compounding restrictions

How to include compounding restriction comment tags in the transducers:
{{{
giv0ri:giv'ri ALBMI ; !+SgNomCmp +SgGenCmp +PlGenCmp
=> (using a perl script or similar)
+SgNomCmp+SgGenCmp+PlGenCmpgiv0ri:giv'ri ALBMI ; !+SgNomCmp +SgGenCmp +PlGenCmp
}}}

__TODO:__
# improve prefix conversion to PLX (__Tomi__)
# improve middle noun conversion to PLX (__Tomi__)
# improve noun + adjective PLX conversion: (__Tomi__)
## compounding stems - how do we generate them? Using the java client?
    {{+SgNomCmp+Cmpnd}} = {{sáme–}}, should give the correct compounding stem,
    shouldn't it? We want to __optionally__ go from: {{sáme-	NLI}} to
    {{sáme	NL}}: {{-	NLI (->) 	NL}}, which means we should be able to
    extract correct compounding stems using xfst methods only.
## compounding tags - we need to obey them when making the transducers. 
    Suggestion - see above.
# make conversion test sample; add conversion testing to the make file
  (__Tomi__)
## to regression test / QA the PLX conversion.
# improve number conversion (__Børre, Tomi__)
# ask for larger disk for the web server (__Trond, Børre__)


!!Errors in latest speller build

Build: Davvisámi, PBeta 1, 2007-05-19 

* first part of multiword expressions not accepted
* errors in numbers - fixed
* no clitics on nouns, adjs
* compound restrictions/rules not yet integrated in speller fsts (but the tags
  necessary to do this can now be included in the transducer)
* suomasápmelaš vs suopmasápmelaš - now both are accepted (which is an
  improvement - earlier only suopmasápmelaš was accepted). What is correct?
  Both?
* {{smj}}: __öä__ not accepted, only __øæ__ (except for lexicalised names).
* ŋ and ñ and ń in {{smj}}

Example: ''maŋŋel'' vs ''maññel / mańńel''

* maññel - ok
* mańńel - ń is not recognised as part of the word, should be reported to
  Polderland

Try __TODO__ before final public beta:
* fix clitics (__Tomi__)
* include improved numbers (__Børre__)


__TODO__ ''after'' the final public beta:
* first part of multiword expressions not accepted (__Tomi__)
* compound restrictions/rules not yet integrated in speller fsts (but the tags
  necessary to do this can now be included in the transducer) (__Tomi__)
* suomasápmelaš vs suopmasápmelaš - now both are accepted (which is an
  improvement - earlier only suopmasápmelaš was accepted). What is correct?
  Only the first one. The second one should be banned by the compound
  restrictions.
* {{smj}}: __öä__ not accepted, only __øæ__ (except for lexicalised names)
  (__Thomas__)
* ŋ and ñ and ń in {{smj}} (__Sjur, Polderland__)
