# 3. Documentation

Corpus web interface: Oslo will take care of everything. Unix access: we'll
bring it up if needed. For the time being web access should suffice for most
users.

# 4. Corpus gathering

**Per-Eric** didn't meet with **Sigga Tuolja-Sandström**, but talked with her
instead. The text licensing contracts should be fixed now. **Per-Eric** will get
the text from another person.

**Børre** talked with **Michal Aase**, and they (Davvi Girji) will send us all
texts for which we have a contract with the authors.

**Per-Eric** talked with Samuel Gælok,  who said that **Iđut** has several of
his texts. There's also another person/publisher in Karasjok that has some of
his texts.

Kulturminnelova in `smj` is only available in paper form, unless
**Anders Kintel** has an electronic copy.

**TODO:**
* add `sma` texts to the corpus repository (**Trond**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

Nothing this week either.

# 6. Infrastructure

**Børre** got the G5 working again. It was caused by a misconfiguration in
the firewall.

We are ordering a new server for faster processing.

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

Remaining twol issues:

```
###  Changed because:we get olmmož-, not olmmoš-

olmmošmuorra
olmmošmuorra    olmmošmuorra    +?

olmmožmuorra
olmmožmuorra    olmmoš+N+SgNomCmp#muorra+N+Sg+Nom

###  Changed because:we get almmáj- and not almmái-
 but this works now:
 almmájmuorra
almmájmuorra    almmájmuorra    +?

almmáimuorra
almmáimuorra    almmái+N+SgNomCmp#muorra+N+Sg+Nom

almmáj-
almmáj- almmáj- +?

almmái-
almmái- almmái+N+SgNomCmp+Cmpnd
```

We are now back to two errors in the twol-test file:

```
### € olmmožX4X7-
### € olmmoš00-

```

The `sme` names from Finland is still not added to the lexicon (**Børre** has
them). This will be done by **Ilona**.

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Maaren**)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
* add the `sme` place names from Finland (**Ilona**)

## Lule Sámi

The `æ-ä` alternation issue has turned into an interesting direction. With the latest speller (29.6.), it behaves like the following:

```
dæbbaga -  ok
däbbaga -  däbboga
           dæbbaga
           dæbbaga--
           dibága
           dibága--
           dubága
           dubága--
           tubága
vællahit - ok
vällahit - vællahit
           vellahit
gæhtjáj  - ok
gähtjáj  - ok
```

That is, `ä` works in some cases, but not in other. `æ` seems to work
everywhere it should.

**Per-Eric** talked to **Nils-Olof Sortelius** at **Sámediggi in Sweden** (`smj` place names), we will have to contact Lennart Dehlin, Lantmäteriverket Lennart.Dehlin(at)lm.se. Also talked to Kåre Tjikkom, who gave P-E the name of the SD/N contact person in place name issues: **Lisa Monika Aslaksen**.

**Kåre Tjikkom** has lost his speller-correct document. **Sjur** will have to find it, or make a new one.

This is probably a speller issue, not a twolc one. The transducers work fine:

```

däbbaga
däbbaga deppa+N+Sg+Gen
däbbaga deppa+N+Pl+Nom
däbbaga dæppa+N+Sg+Gen
däbbaga dæppa+N+Pl+Nom

vällahit
vällahit        vællahit+V+IV+Inf
vällahit        vællahit+V+IV+Imprt+Pl2

gähtjáj
gähtjáj giehtje+N+Sg+Ill
```

From invert transducers (regular and normative):
```
Tomi-si-maskin:~/Documents/eclipse/workspace/gt tomi$ lookup -flags mbTT -utf8 smj/bin/ismj.fst
0%>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>100%
dæppa+N+Sg+Gen
dæppa+N+Sg+Gen  dæbbaga
dæppa+N+Sg+Gen  däbbaga

Tomi-si-maskin:~/Documents/eclipse/workspace/gt tomi$ lookup -flags mbTT -utf8 smj/bin/ismj-norm.fst
0%>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>100%
dæppa+N+Sg+Gen
dæppa+N+Sg+Gen  dæbbaga
```

Normative produces word only with æ.

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* `ä/æ` in speller (**Thomas, Sjur, Trond**)
    - does only work partially, see data above.
* lexicalise words from the Olavi missing list, but check against the pdf
  original where in doubt (**Per-Eric**)
    - needs help with the last part
* add compounding tags to (some weeks of work):
    - nouns (**Thomas**)
        - a few weeks left
    - adjs (**Per-Eric**)
        - done most of them, will have to recheck some
* ask **SD/Sweden** about `smj` place names (**Per-Eric**)
    - done
* call **Samuel Gælok** about texts (**Per-Eric**)
    - done
* call **Kåre Tjikkom** about `smj` place names and correct-doc (**Per-Eric**)
    - done
* resend `smj` speller-correct document to **Kåre Tjikkom** (**Sjur**)

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

This sub-project needs to get up and running soon. Mainly **Sjur's** task.

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

**TODO:**
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## OOo spellers

**Tomi** is working on the lexicon conversion to the Hunspell format. It is moving forward.

TODO:
* add Hunspell data conversion (**Tomi**)

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)
* move **Steinar's** error markup in  the xml files to (a copy of) the original
  (**Børre**)

### Automated testing

**TODO:**
* document the AppleScript testing tool (**Sjur**)
* improve speller test bench (**Sjur**)
    - integrate the `ccat` speller testing options in the Makefile (**Sjur**)
* add extraction of all known spelling errors in the corpus (not the
  `prooftest` corpus), and check that they are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
* how to do a regression **self-test**:
    - extract all the base forms in the lexicon, and run them through the speller
    - extract all SUB-marked entries, and run them through the speller
        - integrate these in the make file (**Sjur**)

## Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

It seems to work quite ok now. We might still consider to ask Xerox for a license.

## New public beta

Delayed till the majority of the present bugs are fixed.

# 10. Other

## Corpus contracts

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra as open-source on NoDaLi-sta
  (**Sjur**)

## Bug fixing

When fixing bugs, record the version number containing the fix in the Bugzilla
bug report, such that for each bug, we know exactly when it should have been
fixed, in what file(s) and what version.

**55** open Divvun/Disamb bugs (**21** of these 56 are speller bugs, **35** are
general bugs), and **23** risten.no bugs

## New team member

Ilona is joining the Divvun project from today - welcome!
Hi! :)

## Board meeting

**Sjur** went to Oslo on Thursday Aug. 16 to meet the board. Some highlights:

Additions to our project accepted by the board:
* `smj` hyphenation
* InDesign speller

The planned release party will be on December 11, in Oslo. All project members
are invited.

## Project meeting

We'll meet in September, 24-28, to work on the hardest remaining issues. Default
location is Kautokeino, but we'll also consider Tromsø until the next project
meeting.

# 11. Next meeting, closing

The next meeting is 27.8.2007, 09:30 Norwegian time.

The meeting was closed at 10:57.
