# 3. Documentation

We want to automatise as much as possible when releasing new public betas.
Suggestion: we make a fully automatic (Bugzilla-RSS + Bugzilla filter) list of
all fixed bugs, and a manual summary of the "highlights". Only the highlights
get translated into different languages.

**TODO:**
* add semi-automatic updates of fixed and open issues to README files
  (**Børre**)
    - not yet

# 4. Corpus gathering

Nothing new.

**TODO:**
* add `sma` Bible texts to the corpus repository (**Trond**)
* add correct type differentiation to XSL processing - bug 504 (**Saara**)
* add correct type differentiation to ccat - bug 505 (**Tomi**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

Nothing.

# 6. Infrastructure

Nothing.

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Maaren**)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
    - add to Bugzilla (**Sjur**)
* add the `sme` place names from Finland (**Ilona**)
    - done! Well, there are some names, that **Ilona** couldn't do anything about.
   **Maaren** has taken the list of those names and she asks about them. At
   least some of them are propably spelling errors.

## Lule Sámi

smj propernoun bug issue:
procedure
1. convert from common base (which means sme base)
    1. Words not convertable should be added to separate smj lexicon, and words that
   should not be converted from sme sme should be moved to non-convert lexicon
   in sme???
1. send to smj morphology

The original todo was to correct the smj morphology.
Current test shows weaknesses in both camps:
* conversion errors
* words that should not have been converten
* missing smj-unique names
* errors in the morphology

Testing procedures:
* analyse baseforms (as for sme)
* generate a couple of caseforms from  the baseforms, and inspect result

Suggestion:
Let us first analyse the proper noun base forms for Lule Sámi, and thereafter
look at the morphology.

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* `ä/æ` in speller, see bug report #411 (**Tomi, Sjur**)
* lexicalise words from the Olavi missing list, but check against the pdf
  original where in doubt (**Per-Eric**)

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

This sub-project needs to get up and running soon. Mainly **Sjur's** task.

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

**TODO:**
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## OOo spellers

**Børre** will try to help out on this, as there are quite a few existing bugs
waiting to be solved by **Tomi**.

TODO:
* add Hunspell data conversion (**Tomi, Børre**)

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)
* move **Steinar's** error markup in the xml files to (a copy of) the original
  (**Børre**)

### Automated testing

We need one more baseform test, one in which all baseforms are run through the
nonrec transducer. Such a test will identify all/most errors in the lexicon and
errors in the baseform extraction. The remaining errors are then related to
speller conversion.

```
cat gt/doc/proof/spelling/testing/selftest-pl-sme-20070909.xml | grep \
'<original>' | cut -d">" -f2 | cut -d"<" -f1 | lookup -flags mbTT \
-utf8 gt/sme/bin/sme.fst | grep '\?' | cut -f1 | wc -l
```

Lex test of the lule-specific words. Three were not recognised:

```
Sálatduottar    Sálatduottar    +?
Várjjat Várjjat +?
Fatjatj Fatjatj +?
```

Abbreviations are currectly printed twice if they should be followed by a full
stop - once with and once without the full stop. - Fixed during the meeting.

**TODO:**
* document the AppleScript testing tool (**Sjur**)
* document the testing procedures (**Sjur**)
* add baseform transducer test (**Sjur**)

## Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

Several smj bugs discovered during last week, and added to Bugzilla: 495, 503,
509, 512. General bugs as well: 421, 486.

Clitics:
```
 +Clt+ge:#ge ENDLEX ;
 +Clt+ge:#k ENDLEX ;

 +Clt+gen:#gen ENDLEX ;
 +Clt+ga:#ga ENDLEX ;
```

The first two are variants of the same clitic, where the variation is governed
by twolc rules. It needs to be generated as part of the PLX generation.

The two other ones are separate clitics, and do not vary according to any rules.
They can thus be put in a separate PLX file to save space and time during
compilation. This solution requires that we give them PLX codes that will
prevent them from combining with word forms already outfitted with the first
clitic. Tomi will look into this, and report back. The issue may require
discussion with Polderland (ie a new subclass tag).

**TODO:**
* fix PLX-related bugs (**Tomi**)
* find a solution for `smj` clitics (**Tomi**)

## New public beta

Delayed till the majority of the present bugs are fixed. - We will evaluate the
situation on Wednesday 19. after lunch, and release a new speller on Friday if
smj is good enough (sme already is).

# 10. Other

## Corpus contracts

Delayed till after final release.

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra as open-source on NoDaLi-sta
  (**Sjur**)

## Bug fixing

When fixing bugs, record the version number containing the fix in the Bugzilla
bug report, such that for each bug, we know exactly when it should have been
fixed, in what file(s) and what version.

**62** open Divvun/Disamb bugs (**32** of these 56 are speller-related bugs,
**30** are general bugs), and **23** risten.no bugs

## Project meeting

We'll meet in September, 24-28, in Tromsø to work on the hardest remaining
issues.

Hotel rooms: Ilona sun-wed, Tomi sun-fri.

**TODO:**
* reserve meeting room (**Thomas**)
* reserve lunch mon-fri, invoice to SD (**Børre**)
* book hotel rooms (**Sjur**)

# 11. Next meeting, closing

The next meeting is 1.10.2007, 09:30 Norwegian time.

The meeting was closed at 10:49.
