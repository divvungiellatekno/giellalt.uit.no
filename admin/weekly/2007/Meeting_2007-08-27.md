# 3. Documentation

Nothing new.

# 4. Corpus gathering

**Børre** has contacted several people, see task status above.

**TODO:**
* add `sma` texts to the corpus repository (**Trond**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

**Saara** has removed the *.html lists from the xdoc folder, and our
multilingual analyser interface is generated via xml.

# 6. Infrastructure

We are ordering a new server for faster processing. - Order not yet placed, we
are waiting for the final, updated and corrected offer. It should arrive today.

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

Remaining twol issues: see
[bug #460](http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=460).
The error at present is connected to forms *olmmoš–* and *háliit*,
as before.

**Ilona** is working on the list of `sme` names from Finland. The list
includes lots of enare sámi names. **Børre** has sent her a new list that
contains all northern sami placenames. **Ilona** has started with that list
instead of the Finland name list. The new list should include all the `sme`
names, also the names that are in the first list.

There is an empty file, `gt/smn/src/propernoun-smn-lex.txt`, in cvs. Inari
names go there, and may then eventually be exported to other lgs.

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Maaren**)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
* fix twol bug (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
    - meet online  this week - Thursday around 12 AM Norwegian time
* add the `sme` place names from Finland (**Ilona**)
    - working on it

## Lule Sámi

The `æ-ä` issue: see [bug 411
| http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=411].

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* `ä/æ` in speller (**Tomi, Sjur**)
    - Works in transducer, not in speller, see bug report (#411)
* lexicalise words from the Olavi missing list, but check against the pdf
  original where in doubt (**Per-Eric**)
* add compounding tags to (some weeks of work):
    - nouns (**Thomas**)
        - a few weeks left
    - adjs (**Per-Eric**)
        - almost finished
* resend `smj` speller-correct document to **Kåre Tjikkom** (**Sjur**)
    - done

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

This sub-project needs to get up and running soon. Mainly **Sjur's** task.

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

**TODO:**
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## OOo spellers

**Tomi** is working on the lexicon conversion to the Hunspell format. It is
moving forward.

```
plx    source ->    transducer -> wordlist in plxformat -> speller binary
       src/*        *-plx.fst         > 60 GB                2 MB
       polderland/*

hun    source -> transducer    -> java/perl-server program -> huncode
       src/*     *-hunspell.fst
```

My question:
The set of noun-verb-adj continuation lexica is taken from a wordlist,
generated by xfst.

1. generate full paradigm per word with xfst (as for polderland today)
1. extract stems automatically <= from the generated paradigm (60 GB)
  and not from the *-lex.txt files.
1. turn the result into hunspell stem / cont

The hunspell generation process thus mirrors the plx generation process. Yes,
but with a different-format output (and a much smaller file - Mb instead of Gb).
That's fine. The important point is that it has the same input, so that Tomi
does not need to rewrite 8000 lines of smX-lex.txt + twol code. Of course:)

We have, in parallel, been looking at sfst. The results are good, sfst seems
a good compiler for fst-s. How it behaves when scaled up to real size we do
not know. A major point regarding spell checkers will be speed - how fast is the
sfst engine?

The sfst version of smX will be put on hold to after newyear.

TODO:
* add Hunspell data conversion (**Tomi**)
    - working on it

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)
* move **Steinar's** error markup in  the xml files to (a copy of) the original
  (**Børre**)

### Automated testing

We need a separate speller pre-processor, to turn ccat output into suitable
speller input. This we will need to be able to run whole documents through
the speller, to test lexical coverage as well as p/r etc.

**TODO:**
* document the AppleScript testing tool (**Sjur**)
* improve speller test bench (**Sjur**)
    - create a speller preprocessor (**Børre** or **Sjur**)
    - integrate the `ccat` speller testing options in the Makefile (**Sjur**)
* add extraction of all known spelling errors in the corpus (not the
  `prooftest` corpus), and check that they are properly corrected
    - put on hold until we have such markup in the regular corpus
* add regression **self-test**:
    - integrate these in the make file (**Sjur**)
        - done

## Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

We have found a [bug](http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=484) in
the conversion. We also have the [double-hyphen
issue|http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=458], which needs to be
fixed in the LexC code (the R lexicon and surrounding matters).

We need a compounding form without a hyphen in speller. In xfst processing
(adding PLX-tags) you can add hyphens but we don't know how to remove a hyphen.

But is this a lexc problem? Probably not, see below (sme.fst, sme-norm.fst,
spellernonrec-sme.save all give the same result):

```
-bash-3.00$ lookup -flags mbTT -utf8 sme/bin/spellernonrec-sme.save

```

**TODO:**
* fix bug 484 (**Tomi**)
* fix bug 458 (**Trond, Sjur**)

## New public beta

Delayed till the majority of the present bugs are fixed. The twolc bug
is the major stopper.

# 10. Other

## Corpus contracts

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra as open-source on NoDaLi-sta
  (**Sjur**)

## Bug fixing

When fixing bugs, record the version number containing the fix in the Bugzilla
bug report, such that for each bug, we know exactly when it should have been
fixed, in what file(s) and what version.

**57** open Divvun/Disamb bugs (**29** of these 56 are speller-related bugs,
**28** are general bugs), and **23** risten.no bugs

## Project meeting

We'll meet in September, 24-28, in Tromsø to work on the hardest remaining
issues.

# 11. Next meeting, closing

The next meeting is 3.9.2007, 09:30 Norwegian time.

The meeting was closed at 10:54.
