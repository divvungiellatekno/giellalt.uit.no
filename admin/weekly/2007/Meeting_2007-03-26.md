# 3. Documentation

The open documentation issues fall into these three categories:
* Beta documentation for testers
* Documentation for the online corpora
* General documentation improvement after Steinar's test (for open-source
  release)

TODO:
* write form to request corpus user account (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed till after the beta release
* document how to apply for access to closed corpus, and details on the corpus
  and its use in general (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed till after the beta release
* correct and improve it based on feedback from **Steinar** (**Børre**)
    - low priority
* beta documentation (see separate beta section below)

# 4. Corpus gathering

**Trond** added one new text from **Harald Gaski**
corp$ convert2xml.pl orig/sme/facta/file.doc

TODO:
* `sme` texts: no new additions, fix corpus errors during this month
  (**Børre, Trond, Saara**)
* missing `nob` parallel texts should be added if such holes are found
  (**Børre, Trond**)
* Go through the list of missing or errouneous `nob` texts, based upon
  **Saara's** perfect list (**Børre, Trond**)
* add `sma` texts to the corpus repository (**Børre**)
* add missing words from new corpus text (**Maaren**)
```
  Go to victorio,
  cd gt/sme
  ccat -l sme zcorp/bound/sme/facta/Girjjalasv_doahpagat.doc.xml | preprocess
  --abbr=bin/abbr.txt --corr=src/typos.txt | lo | grep '\?' | cut -f1 | sort |
  uniq -c | sort -nr | less
```

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## Alignment

**TODO**
* go through other directories (nob dicrectories, sd directories), fix
  parallellity information for other documents (2 hours)
  (**Børre**)
* Improve the automatic process:
    - Improve the anchor list and realign (**Trond, Børre**)
    - Only adding words does not improve alignment, you have to consider the format
   as well. If you cut with star e.g guo* too early, wrong word can be selected.
    - The documents have still some formatting issues which cause trouble in
   alignment. (In some documents tables are included to the text, some not,
   etc.)
    - Test and improve settings in the aligner
* Align manually (**Trond, Steinar**) (especially shorter terminological texts)
  good idea. **Saara** will look for troublesome texts and prepare them for
  manual alignment.

# 6. Infrastructure

**TODO:**
* update and fix our documentation and infrastructure as **Steinar** finds
  problem areas (**Børre**)
    - started, working on it

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

**Maaren** is working on actio compounds, using the info found in Nickel.
**Thomas** wants to make sure we're understanding the issue in the same way.
They will discuss this further after the meeting.

```
LEXICON BOAHTALADDAN ! not compounding
LEXICON BOAHTIN ! compounding, like: boahtin-
```

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Maaren**)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
    - postponed till after the public beta

## Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

**TODO:**
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## OOo speller(s)

TODO after the MS Office Beta is delivered:
* add Aspell/Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study Hunspell, perhaps also Soikko (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)
    - Aspell is not suitable
    - Soikko is not a viable alternative either (they are looking for replacing
   their technology with SFST - an interesting cooperation possibility in the
   future) - they're using Malaga now (no HunSpell code).
    - HunSpell will be our choice for now

## Testing

### Selecting test texts

In principle, we need the same text types as the ones we already aim at in our
corpus. In practice, we must use new, unseen texts. We would like to have a
balanced input of texts, but right now:

* Min Áigi net issue
* Blogs
* Our own linguistic texts
* New department texts from the net

### Storing test texts

**TODO:**
* Manually mark test texts for typos (making them into gold standards)
  (**Steinar**)
    - `erorr§errors`
    - when correcting to multiple strings: `erorr.Og§(error. Og)`
        - update correction markup xml conversion to handle the second case
    (**Saara**)
* Add the marked test texts to the `corpus/prooftest/orig/` catalogue
  (**Børre, Thomas, Trond, Steinar, Maaren**)
    - done
* change `ccat` to handle error/correction markup (**Tomi**)
    - extract the document text with original errors (input to standard speller
   test) - default? yes
    - extract the document text with the available corrections (the correct docu),
   to be used to automatically evaluate testing tool output; could also be used
   to give the corpus tagger an easier job:-)
    - extract all and only the spelling errors with their corrections, in a tab
   separated file: `erorr<TAB>correction` - just as typos.txt. Used for
   regression testing (making sure we don't take steps back)
    - extract both the original text and their corrections, in a tab
   separated file: `erorr<TAB>correction` - just as typos.txt. Used for
   another type of speller testing. `correction` should be an emtpy string if
   there is no correction.
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not)
    - add the wanted xml elements to the XSL header (**Saara**) (source info is
   the same as for regular docs):
        - outworned (ie not suitable for speller testing any more, only for regression
    testing)
        - lexicalised (all unknown, correctly spelled words added to lexicon)
* Conduct tests on new beta versions on the basis of the unspoiled gold standard
  documents (**whoever has time**), and fill in data from testing (the testers:
  **who?**)
* alternatively: make test scripts that will run the tests automatically,
  collect the numbers, and transform them into test results (**Sjur**)
* include the ones already tested in the `testing/` catalogue
* test 0.3 on the same texts
* test each version before beta release

### Testing tools

**TODO:**
* document the AppleScript testing tool (**Sjur**)
    - not finished
* write tools for statistical analysis of test results (**Sjur**)
    - started, **Saara** continued, will continue with Forrest integration

### Regression tests

**TODO:**
* add extraction of all known spelling errors in the corpus (not the
  `prooftest` corpus), and check that they are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
* test the `typos.txt` list, and check that all entries are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
* consider how to do a regression **self-test**, ie, how to test the full
  wordlist (**Børre, Sjur**)

## Localisation

We need to translate the info added to our front page (and a separate page)
regarding the beta release. Also the press release needs to be translated.

TODO:
* translate beta release docs to `sme` (**Thomas**)
* translate beta release docs to `smj` (**Thomas**)

## Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

**TODO:**
1. add `gt/cwb/paradigm.smj.txt` file into `gt/script/server_anl.pl`
  (**Saara**)
    1. done
1. add prefixes to the PLX (**Børre**)
1. middle nouns (**Børre**)
1. add Makefile target for PLX conversion of lexc files (**Tomi**):
    1. done
    1. adjectives
    1. nouns
    1. propernouns
    1. verbs derived into other POSes
    1. verbs - must be done on gtsvn.uit.no
        1. produced by the paradigm server on victorio? or regenerate every night, and
    make it available for regular download? (**Tomi, Saara**)
1. make conversion test sample; add conversion testing to the make file
  (**Tomi**)
1. improve number conversion (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. compile verb lists on victorio, make them available on our public server
  (**Saara, Sjur**)
1. speed issue with `smj` verb derivations - and this is only derivations to
  non-verbs (**Tomi, Saara, Sjur**)

## Public Beta release

Due to the problems with generating the PLX files discussed above, we need to
move the release date further. End of March?

Linguistic issues still open:
* prefixes (eahpe, ii-) (**Børre**)
* middle nouns (LEXICON: lexc: Rmiddle, plx: L) (**Børre**)

**DONE:**
* delivered PLX data of `sme` and `smj` including compounding
* translated Windows installer to `sme` and `smj`
* installed PLX compiler in G5 at `/usr/local/bin/mklex*` (one version for
  `sme` and one for `smj`)
* added resources needed for compiling PLX lexicons to our cvs repo
* tested the beta drop from Polderland - good we did, it is absolutely
  unacceptable (our responsibiliby - only linguistic errors (poor coverage)
  found so far)
* questions for Polderland:
    - version info in the speller
        - done
    - remaking/updating the installer packages with linguistic updates
        - we have received complete installer packages
