# 3. Documentation

The open documentation issues fall into these three categories:
* Beta documentation for testers
* Documentation for the online corpora
* General documentation improvement after Steinar's test (for open-source
  release)

TODO:
* write form to request corpus user account (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed till after the beta release
* document how to apply for access to closed corpus, and details on the corpus
  and its use in general (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed till after the beta release
* correct and improve it based on feedback from **Steinar** (**Børre**)
    - low priority
* beta documentation (see separate beta section below)

# 4. Corpus gathering

**Børre** and **Sjur** had a small talk on Friday on how to continue the
contract signing process, and thus get more texts.

TODO:
* `sme` texts: no new additions, fix corpus errors during this month
  (**Børre, Trond, Saara**)
* missing `nob` parallel texts should be added if such holes are found
  (**Børre, Trond**)
* Go through the list of missing or errouneous `nob` texts, based upon
  **Saara's** perfect list (**Børre, Trond**)
* add `sma` texts to the corpus repository (**Børre**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## Alignment

The aligner is now working so well that we are not able to find errors anymore.
We are now waiting for **Lars** to make new texts available, and the anchor list
needs to be updated with new genres. Also, for the users, the error in the web
interface made all texts seem misaligned (they were off by one sentence). This
is also corrected now.

**TODO**
* check with **Lars** when more texts are ready (**Trond**)

# 6. Infrastructure

**TODO:**
* update and fix our documentation and infrastructure as **Steinar** finds
  problem areas (**Børre**)
* fix internet setup for **Per-Eric's** satelite modem (**Sjur, Børre**)
    - this influences iChat, SEE sharing, and ARD connetions

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Maaren**)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
    - postponed till after the public beta

## Lule Sámi

The work is progressing very fine, a bit slow in the beginning, but that is
expected.

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

**TODO:**
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## OOo speller(s)

TODO after the MS Office Beta is delivered:
* add Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study the Hunspell formalism in detail (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)
    - **Børre** did some reading, and compiled Hunspell

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* Manually mark test texts for typos (making them into gold standards)
  (**Steinar**)
    - continued the mark-up
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not)
    - add the wanted xml elements to the XSL header (**Saara**) (source info is
   the same as for regular docs):
        - worn out (ie not suitable for speller testing any more, only for regression
    testing)
        - lexicalised (all unknown, correctly spelled words added to lexicon)
* Conduct tests on new beta versions on the basis of the unspoiled gold standard
  documents (**whoever has time**), and fill in data from testing (the testers:
  **who?**)
    - we need new betas!
* alternatively: make test scripts that will run the tests automatically,
  collect the numbers, and transform them into test results (**Sjur**)
    - done, except that they don't work with our tailored Forrest
        - **Børre** worked around this by using `xsltproc` to produce Forrest
    document format directly.
* include the files already publically tested into the `prooftest` cataloge
  (**Steinar, Trond**)
* add automatic testing to the make files for other test types
  (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)
* test each version before beta release
    - we don't have a public beta release candidate yet:(

### Testing tools

**TODO:**
* document the AppleScript testing tool (**Sjur**)
* improve speller test bench (**Sjur**)
    - Forrest bug needs to be debugged (**Børre, Sjur**)
        - **Børre** found a work-around
    - integrate the ccat speller testing options in the Makefile (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* ask for Linux version of the Polderland command-line speller (for victorio)
  (**Sjur**)

### Regression tests

**TODO:**
* add extraction of all known spelling errors in the corpus (not the
  `prooftest` corpus), and check that they are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - `ccat` now ready, it should be integrated in the Makefile (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* test the `typos.txt` list, and check that all entries are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
* consider how to do a regression **self-test**, ie, how to test the full
  wordlist (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - extract all the base forms in the lexicon, and run them through the speller
    - extract all SUB-marked entries, and run them through the lexicon
        - integrate these in the make file (**Sjur**)

## Localisation

We need to translate the info added to our front page (and a separate page)
regarding the beta release. Also the press release needs to be translated.

TODO:
* translate beta release docs to `sme` (**Thomas**)
* translate beta release docs to `smj` (**Thomas**)

## Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

The conversion itself is working fine, but we are still having problems
producing output acceptable to the `mklex` speller compiler. We have huge
files to sort, and all sorts of problems pop up because of the size.
We probably need new, big disks on **victorio**, and/or on the **G5**.

**TODO:**
* ask MacOffice for larger disks for the G5 (**Børre**)
* ask for larger disks for victorio (**Børre, Trond**)
* ask for newer server OS on victorio, many of the installed tools are quite old
  (it is using Cent OS - a new version was released not long ago)
  (**Børre, Trond**)
* ask for mklex for Linux (victorio) from Polderland (**Sjur**)

### Compounding restrictions

How to include compounding restriction comment tags in the transducers:
```
giv0ri:giv'ri ALBMI ; !+SgNomCmp +SgGenCmp +PlGenCmp
=> (using a perl script or similar)
+SgNomCmp+SgGenCmp+PlGenCmpgiv0ri:giv'ri ALBMI ; !
```

**TODO:**
1. improve prefix conversion to PLX (**Tomi**)
1. improve middle noun conversion to PLX (**Tomi**)
1. improve noun + adjective PLX conversion: (**Tomi**)
    1. compounding stems - how do we generate them? Using the java client?
    `+SgNomCmp+Cmpnd` = `sáme–`, should give the correct compounding stem,
    shouldn't it? We want to **optionally** go from: `sáme-	NLI` to
    `sáme	NL`: `-	NLI (->) 	NL`, which means we should be able to
    extract correct compounding stems using xfst methods only.
    1. compounding tags - we need to obey them when making the transducers.
    Suggestion - see above.
1. make conversion test sample; add conversion testing to the make file
  (**Tomi**)
    1. to regression test / QA the PLX conversion.
1. improve number conversion (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. ask for larger disk for the web server (**Trond, Børre**)

## Public Beta release

**TODO:**
* working and updated `smj` speller (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add numbers, compound restrictions to both spellers if time permits
  (**Børre, Tomi**)
* finish press release (**Sjur**)
* add info to front page (incl. download links) (**Børre**)
    - download page made, only needs to add the speller beta when it is ready.
* write separate page with detailed info (incl. download links) (**Børre**)
    - a separate page for the beta speller, with installation instructions, etc.
* translate press release, web pages (**Børre, Thomas, whoever**)
* collect a list of PR recipients, forward to Berit Karen Paulsen
  (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* test speller installers on Windows and Mac (**Børre**)
    - we have a new multilingual Windows installer, which needs to be tested
        - tested and ok
* update installer packages with latest speller lexicon (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - we need to test the procedure, and make sure it works

# 10. Other

## Corpus contracts

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra as open-source on NoDaLi-sta
  (**Sjur**)
    - **delayed** until the public beta is out the door

## Bug fixing

**35** open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and **23** risten.no bugs

**Sjur** hasn't received Bugzilla reminders this year... The reminder should
include all non-closed/non-open bugs not touched in the last 14 days.
**Sjur**, as a project manager, would like to have a status report on all open
and untouched bugs.

**TODO:**
* look over the Bugzilla status mails (**Børre**)
