# 3. Documentation

Nothing done last week.

TODO:
* write form to request corpus user account (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* document how to apply for access to closed corpus, and details on the corpus
  and its use in general (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* add short description on our front page on anonymous cvs and corpus access,
  with links to relevant documentation (**Børre**)

# 4. Corpus gathering

Nothing new. We need to work systematically on filling our corpus holes,
although not this and the next month.

TODO:
* `sme` texts: no new additions, fix corpus errors during this month
  (**Børre, Trond, Saara**)
* missing `nob` parallel texts should be added if such holes are found
  (**Børre, Trond**)
* Go through the list of missing or errouneous `nob` texts, based upon
  **Saara's** perfect list (**Børre, Trond**)
* add `sma` texts to the corpus repository (**Børre**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## Alignment

**TODO:**
* go through other directories (nob dicrectories, sd directories), fix
  parallellity information for other documents (2 hours)
  (**Børre**)
* when aligned, send aligned, xml `nob` texts to **Kristin** (**Saara**)
    - done

## Conversion issues

**TODO:**
* report conversion errors to **Saara** (**Trond, Steinar**)
* Have a look at the two suggestions for pdf discussed in the previous
  meeting (**Saara**)
    - implemented replacement of r vv with rvv. The source of the error is in
   pdf-conversion, where the space between r and double v is falsely interpreted
   as space-mark. This concerns only one document and only r and double v.
        - Comment: any initial double consonant is an indication of a space
    too much (no initial geminates in Sámi).
    - The hyphens in page breaks are now replaced with <hyph/>, although I'm still
   testing it.

# 6. Infrastructure

Nothing happened last week.

**TODO:**
* test our infrastructure and documentation - follow the documentation exactly,
  and find problem areas - report problems to **Børre**. Start: At the front
  page. (**Steinar**)
* update and fix our documentation and infrastructure as **Steinar** finds
  problem areas (**Børre**)

# 7. Linguistics

* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)

### Numbers:

TODO:
* discontinous case inflection (but only for maximally three-part compound
  numerals) (`viđain/goalmmát/logiin` and `guvttiin/logiin/viđain`)
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
    - done `smj`
* produce correct number base forms in the analyzer (**Thomas, Trond**)
    - done `smj`
* Go through the Num bugs (**Trond, Thomas, Steinar**)
    - done `smj` one bug #372

  (**Trond**)

### Hyphenation problem

TODO:

* ask Ove Lorentz to report on our `sma` hyphenator (**Trond**)
** Done. Still minor problems with handling of all-caps forms, but otherwise
   ok.

## Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* Lack of lowering/fronting before hyphen: Twol rewrite. (**Thomas, Trond**)

    - done
* also done: numbers

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
