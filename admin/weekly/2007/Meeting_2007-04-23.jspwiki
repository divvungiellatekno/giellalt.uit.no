!!!3. Documentation

The open documentation issues fall into these three categories:
* Beta documentation for testers
* Documentation for the online corpora
* General documentation improvement after Steinar's test (for open-source
  release)


TODO:
* write form to request corpus user account (__Børre, Sjur, Trond__)
** delayed till after the beta release
* document how to apply for access to closed corpus, and details on the corpus
  and its use in general (__Børre, Sjur, Trond__)
** delayed till after the beta release
* correct and improve it based on feedback from __Steinar__ (__Børre__)
** low priority
* beta documentation (see separate beta section below)



!!!4. Corpus gathering

__Børre__ has gathered a lot of documents from the OAO department in Sámediggi,
most available in victorio, in our prooftest corpus branch.

TODO:
* {{sme}} texts: no new additions, fix corpus errors during this month
  (__Børre, Trond, Saara__)
* missing {{nob}} parallel texts should be added if such holes are found
  (__Børre, Trond__)
* Go through the list of missing or errouneous {{nob}} texts, based upon
  __Saara's__ perfect list (__Børre, Trond__)
* add {{sma}} texts to the corpus repository (__Børre__)


!!!5. Corpus infrastructure

!!Alignment

__TODO__
* Improve the automatic process:
** Improve the anchor list and realign (__Trond, Børre__)
** Only adding words does not improve alignment, you have to consider the format
   as well. If you cut with star e.g guo@ too early, wrong word can be selected.
** The documents have still some formatting issues which cause trouble in
   alignment. (In some documents tables are included to the text, some not,
   etc.)
** Test and improve settings in the aligner
* Align manually (__Trond, Steinar__) (especially shorter terminological texts)
  good idea. __Saara__ will look for troublesome texts and prepare them for
  manual alignment.



!!!6. Infrastructure

__TODO:__
* update and fix our documentation and infrastructure as __Steinar__ finds
  problem areas (__Børre__)



!!!7. Linguistics

!!North Sámi

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: ''vuolggasadji''  vs. ''vuolginsadji''
  (__Maaren__)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case {{o}} (__Sjur, Thomas, Trond__)
** postponed till after the public beta


!!Lule Sámi

A lot of work was done last week, as part of __Thomas__ training __Per-Eric__.

TODO:
* refine {{smj}} proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (__Thomas, Trond__)


!!!8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/doc/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

__TODO:__
# fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (__Saara__)
# finish first version of the editing (__Sjur__)
# test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (__Sjur, Thomas, Trond__)
# make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (__Sjur, Saara__)
# convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (__Sjur, Tomi, Saara__)
# implement data synchronisation between [risten.no|http://www.risten.no] and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
# start to use the xml file as source file
# clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (__Thomas, Maaren, linguists__)
# merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (__linguists__)
# publish the name lexicon on risten.no (__Sjur__)
# add missing parallel names for placenames (__linguists__)
# add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (__linguists__)


!!!9. Spellers

!!OOo speller(s)

TODO after the MS Office Beta is delivered:
* add Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (__Tomi__ - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study the Hunspell formalism in detail (__Børre, Sjur, Tomi__)



!!Testing

!Spelling Error Markup

__TODO:__
* Manually mark test texts for typos (making them into gold standards)
  (__Steinar__)
* change {{ccat}} to handle error/correction markup (__Tomi__)
** extract the whole text, both the original text and their corrections, in a
   tab separated file: {{erorr<TAB>correction}} - just as typos.txt. Used for
   another type of speller testing. {{correction}} should be an emtpy string if
   there is no correction.
*** done, see --help for documenation
*** if the option doesn't show up in --help, the installed binary isn't updated.
    Please ask __Saara__ to compile and install if so. __Tomi__ should check
    whether the newest {{ccat}} is available in __victorio/G5__
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not)
** add the wanted xml elements to the XSL header (__Saara__) (source info is
   the same as for regular docs):
*** outworned (ie not suitable for speller testing any more, only for regression
    testing)
*** lexicalised (all unknown, correctly spelled words added to lexicon)
* Conduct tests on new beta versions on the basis of the unspoiled gold standard
  documents (__whoever has time__), and fill in data from testing (the testers: 
  __who?__)
** __Steinar__ has done this sporadically
* alternatively: make test scripts that will run the tests automatically,
  collect the numbers, and transform them into test results (__Sjur__)
** done, except that they don't work with our tailored Forrest
* include the files already publically tested into the {{prooftest}} cataloge
  (__Steinar, Trond__)
* test each version before beta release
** we don't have a public beta release candidate yet:(



!Testing tools

__TODO:__
* document the AppleScript testing tool (__Sjur__)
* improve speller test bench (__Sjur__)
** first usable version done
** Forrest bug needs to be debugged (__Børre, Sjur__)
** integrate the ccat speller testing options in the Makefile (__Sjur, Tomi__)



!Regression tests

__TODO:__
* add extraction of all known spelling errors in the corpus (not the
  {{prooftest}} corpus), and check that they are properly corrected
  (__Børre, Sjur__)
** {{ccat}} now ready, it should be integrated in the Makefile (__Sjur, Tomi__)
* test the {{typos.txt}} list, and check that all entries are properly corrected
  (__Børre, Sjur__)
* consider how to do a regression __self-test__, ie, how to test the full
  wordlist (__Børre, Sjur__)
** extract all the base forms in the lexicon, and run them through the speller
** extract all SUB-marked entries, and run them through the lexicon
*** integrate these in the make file (__Sjur__)



!!Localisation

We need to translate the info added to our front page (and a separate page)
regarding the beta release. Also the press release needs to be translated.

TODO:
* translate beta release docs to {{sme}} (__Thomas__)
* translate beta release docs to {{smj}} (__Thomas__)



!!Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

Postverbal clitics - the discussion moved in another direction, and the topic
was forgotten. The status of the latest speller is: postverbal clitics __are__
recognised. Topic closed.

!Numbers

__TODO:__
* add numbers as figures to the PLX sources (__Børre__)
** done


!Compounding restrictions

How to include compounding restriction comment tags in the transducers:
{{{
giv0ri:giv'ri ALBMI ; !+SgNomCmp +SgGenCmp +PlGenCmp
=> (using a perl script or similar)
+SgNomCmp+SgGenCmp+PlGenCmpgiv0ri:giv'ri ALBMI ; !
}}}

__TODO:__
# improve prefix conversion to PLX (__Tomi__)
# improve middle noun conversion to PLX (__Tomi__)
# improve noun + adjective PLX conversion: (__Tomi__)
## compounding stems - how do we generate them? Using the java client?
    {{+SgNomCmp+Cmpnd}} = {{sáme–}}, should give the correct compounding stem,
    shouldn't it? We want to __optionally__ go from: {{sáme-	NLI}} to
    {{sáme	NL}}: {{-	NLI (->) 	NL}}, which means we should be able to
    extract correct compounding stems using xfst methods only.
## compounding tags - we need to obey them when making the transducers. 
    Suggestion - see above.
# add propernouns to xfst-based conversion
## done
# make conversion test sample; add conversion testing to the make file
  (__Tomi__)
## to regression test / QA the PLX conversion.
# improve number conversion (__Børre, Tomi__)
# run xfst-based PLX conversion on victorio, make the result available on our
  public server (__Saara, Sjur__)
## done, but the web server (the humfak server) disk is too small - the present
   disk size is 10 Gb, we need at least 50 Gb. 100 Gb should give us room to
   grow. __Trond, Børre__ to ask for larger disk.



!!Public Beta release

We still have problems with sorting the PLX data. We will have Polderland sort
it, and make the beta. We need to investigate where the error is in our tool
chain.

letter ''a'' from the sorted file:

{{{
14583071        al-le!ruo-vá-tjij-da-sis-ka     NIR
14583072        al-le   VI
14583073        al-le   NIALR
14583074        al-le^Aruo-vá-tjijt     NIR
}}}
