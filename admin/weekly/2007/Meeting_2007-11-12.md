## North Sámi

We solved(?) the hypheantion problem, but got instead a circularity problem.
Meeting 12:30 Norw. time Tuesday to fix the circularity problem after the
hyphenation fix.

**TODO:**

    - done, but not tested
* fix circularity issue (**Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)

## Lule Sámi

Name conversion improvements last week.

**TODO:**

  original where in doubt (**Per-Eric**)
    - **Ilona** is working on the last letter in the alphabet, we're almost
   finished:)
* `sme->smj` lexicon conversion to build bilingual lexicon resources, and
  increase `smj` coverage (**Trond, Thomas, Svenne**)
    - some additions coming in there as well, but not until we have checked every
   new word manually

    - done

    - nothing more to be done
* look at missing baseforms (**Thomas**)
    - only two missing baseforms at the moment:)

# 7. Name lexicon infrastructure

This sub-project needs to get up and running soon. Mainly **Sjur's** task.

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

**TODO:**
1. set up Tomcat and risten.no on the G5 again (**Sjur, Børre**)
    1. install risten.no
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 8. Proofing tools

## Hunspell

TODO:
1. Follow-up support for the sami languages in OpenOffice.org (**Børre, Sjur**)
    1. there is still hope to get them included in OOo 2.4
1. Hunspell lexicon conversion (**Tomi, Børre**)
    1. nothing major happened last week, working on getting the basic conversion
   correctly (ie complete and correct inflection), then adding derivation
1. add hunspell testing to the make file (**Sjur**)
    1. done

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)
* move **Steinar's** error markup in the xml files to (a copy of) the original
  (**Børre, Kimme**)
* add nested error markup to xml conversion (**Saara**)
* test new and nested error markup (**Sjur**)

### Automated testing

Paradigm testing implemented, but the reporting needs improvements. Testing
manually:

```
cd gt/sme/testing
gen-paradigms.sh
```

Output in `paradigm-sme.txt`.

Test words should go in the file
`parawlist.txt`. The format is like this:

```
WORD<TAB>POS
áigi	n
ráhkistit	v
```

We need to separate proper nouns from regular nouns properly, by checking the
files `prop-codes.txt` and `n-codes.txt`, as well as making sure the
Makefile has support for proper noun paradigm generation.

**TODO:**
* add hyphenation testing (**Sjur**)
* add hunspell testing (**Saara, Sjur**)
    - implemented
* add paradigm testing (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - done, but needs improvements

### MS Office

We need to check that the proofing tools are working in all Office applications,
not only Word. This is especially important on Windows, which includes quite a
few applications in the bundle.

**TODO:**
* test the proofing tools with all MS Office applications (**Børre, Thomas**)

## Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

Open issues based on test results:

### smj
482 - still problematic, 552 - still open, Svierigadárogielan - still rejected

### sme
397 - not as good as it should be, 408 - fixed, 419, 425 - roman
number, 431, 452 - *miel* is a prefix, 461 - *ovda* accepted, almost 50 %
(17) gets correct suggestion, 489, 508 - fixed, 522, 524.

**TODO:**
* look at test cases still not behaving properly (**Thomas, Tomi**)

## InDesign tools

**TODO:**
* add hyphenation testing (**Sjur**)

## Hyphenators

We should look into the possibility of generating pattern-based hyphenation for
OOo. It shouldn't be too hard, or require too much work, but needs
investigation.

**TODO:**
* get command line hyphenator (**Sjur**)

## Release version

We need to print the CD cover pretty soon, and for that we need to finish the CD
cover, especially the back side text. The cover proof print should be ready in 14 days, ie Nov. 26.

**TODO:**
* try to burn a CD at SD (**Risten, Leif-Åge**)
* finish text to go on the CD cover (**Risten**)
* set up CD-printing printer (**Risten**)
* fix Windows CD installation bug (**Sjur, Børre**)
* get price and schedule for printed CD cover (**Risten**)

## Actual release

December 11-13, one of these days.

# 9. Other

## Corpus contracts

Delayed till after final release.

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra as open-source on NoDaLi-sta
  (**Sjur**)

## Faroese

Speller for `fao` using our infrastructure and the knowledge we have.

**TODO:**
* set up a telephone meeting with them and **Sjur** (**Trond**)

## Bug fixing

When fixing bugs, record the version number containing the fix in the Bugzilla
bug report, such that for each bug, we know exactly when it should have been
fixed, in what file(s) and what version.

**69** open Divvun/Disamb bugs (**35** of these 56 are speller-related bugs,
**34** are other bugs), and **23** risten.no bugs

## Dictionaries

We have now 7 dictionaries in xml format that could be published in a
risten.no-like framework. **Trond** would like to have them online, both for the
feedback and usefulness to the public.

It requires that eXist/XQuery + homepage, and conversion to a proper
presentation format is in place.

**TODO**:
* eXist on G5 - done
* risten.no on G5 - homepage done, but needs port tweaking/changing
* risten.no XQuery framework - NOT done
* XInclude conversion script - NOT done
* homepage on the documetation pages - draft done

## Parallel corpora

There will be a parallel corpus seminar this weekend. It would have been
nice to have parallel text for that:

* fkvnob (from Kvensk Institutt)
* smenob, smanob, smjnob (from Sámi skuvlahistorjá)

**TODO:**
* discuss more parallel texts (**Børre, Saara, Trond**)

## SD yearly personell seminar

6.-7. December. **Sjur** will discuss it with Julia, but our view is that we
don't have time to go this year. The release are just a few days later.
