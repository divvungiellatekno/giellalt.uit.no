# 3. Documentation

The open documentation issues fall into these three categories:
* Beta documentation for testers
* Documentation for the online corpora
* General documentation improvement after Steinar's test (for open-source
  release)

TODO:
* write form to request corpus user account (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed till after the beta release
* document how to apply for access to closed corpus, and details on the corpus
  and its use in general (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed till after the beta release
* correct and imrove it based on feedback from **Steinar** (**Børre**)
    - low priority
* beta documentation (see separate beta section below)

# 4. Corpus gathering

TODO:
* `sme` texts: no new additions, fix corpus errors during this month
  (**Børre, Trond, Saara**)
* missing `nob` parallel texts should be added if such holes are found
  (**Børre, Trond**)
* Go through the list of missing or errouneous `nob` texts, based upon
  **Saara's** perfect list (**Børre, Trond**)
* add `sma` texts to the corpus repository (**Børre**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## Alignment

**TODO**
* go through other directories (nob dicrectories, sd directories), fix 
  parallellity information for other documents (2 hours)
  (**Børre**)
* Improve the automatic process:
    - Improve the anchor list and realign (**Trond, Børre**)
    - Only adding words does not improve alignment, you have to consider the format
   as well. If you cut with star e.g guo* too early, wrong word can be selected.
    - The documents have still some formatting issues which cause trouble in
   alignment. (In some documents tables are included to the text, some not,
   etc.)
    - Test and improve settings in the aligner
* Align manually (**Trond, Steinar**) (especially shorter terminological texts)
  good idea. **Saara** will look for troublesome texts and prepare them for
  manual alignment.

# 6. Infrastructure

**TODO:**
* add report to `gt/doc/infra/`, probably as `infrareport.jspwiki`
  (**Steinar**)
    - done
* update and fix our documentation and infrastructure as **Steinar** finds
  problem areas (**Børre**)
    - started, working on it

# 7. Linguistics

## North Sámi

TODO:
* lexicalise actio compounds. Example: *vuolggasadji*  vs. *vuolginsadji*
  (**Maaren**)
* fix stuorra-oslolaš lower case `o` (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
    - postponed till after the public beta

## Lule Sámi

**Trond** fixed a bug where initial capital vowel blocked the CG rule to work.
The solution was to define capital letter vowel symbols as Vow.

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

**TODO:**
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 9. Spellers

## OOo speller(s)

TODO after the MS Office Beta is delivered:
* add Aspell/Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study Hunspell, perhaps also Soikko (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)

## Testing

### Selecting test texts

In principle, we need the same text types as the ones we already aim at in our 
corpus. In practice, we must use new, unseen texts. We would like to have a
balanced input of texts, but right now:

* Min Áigi net issue
* Blogs
* Our own linguistic texts
* New department texts from the net

### Storing test texts

**TODO:**
* Set up (sub)directories (**Saara**)
    - top-level dir `corpus/prooftest/orig/` and `corpus/prooftest/xml/`
        - done
* Manually mark test texts for typos (making them into gold standards)
  (**Steinar, Maaren**)
    - `erorr§errors`
* Add the marked test texts to the orig/ catalogue
  (**Børre, Thomas, Trond, Steinar, Maaren**)
* Format the added texts in appropriate ways - use our existing xml format, with
  correct markup as decided earlier (the only thing that separate these
  documents from regular corpus documents is the directory (tree) in which they
  reside), thus regular corpus conversion tools, plus error markup (**Saara**)
  Resulting xml is:
  `<error correct="correction">spelling_error</error>`, ie
  `<error correct="álo">alo</error>`
    - done
* change `ccat` to handle error/correction markup (**Tomi**)
    - extract the document text with original errors (input to standard speller
   test) - default? yes
    - extract the document text with the available corrections (the correct docu),
   to be used to automatically evaluate testing tool output; could also be used
   to give the corpus tagger an easier job:-)
    - extract all and only the spelling errors with their corrections, in a tab
   separated file: `erorr<TAB>correction` - just as typos.txt. Used for
   regression testing (making sure we don't take steps back)
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not)
    - add the wanted xml elements to the XSL header (**Saara**?) (source info is
   the same as for regular docs):
        - outworned (ie not suitable for speller testing any more, only for regression
    testing)
        - lexicalised (all unknown, correctly spelled words added to lexicon)
* Conduct tests on new beta versions on the basis of the unspoiled gold standard
  documents (**whoever has time**), and fill in data from testing (the testers: 
  **who?**)
* alternatively: make test scripts that will run the tests automatically,
  collect the numbers, and transform them into test results (**Sjur**)
* include the ones already tested in the `testing/` catalogue
* test 0.3 on the same texts
* test each version before beta release

### Testing tools

**TODO:**
* get updated Polderland testing tools (**Sjur**)
    - got them - they're working excellent (somewhat weird output, though)
* document the AppleScript testing tool (**Sjur**)
    - not finished
* write tools for statistical analysis of test results (**Sjur**)

### Regression tests

**TODO:**
* add extraction of all known spelling errors in the corpus (not the
  `prooftest` corpus), and check that they are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
* test the `typos.txt` list, and check that all entries are properly corrected
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
* consider how to do a regression **self-test**, ie, how to test the full
  wordlist (**Børre, Sjur**)

## Localisation

We need to translate the info added to our front page (and a separate page)
regarding the beta release. Also the press release needs to be translated.

TODO:
* translate beta release docs to `sme` (**Thomas**)
* translate beta release docs to `smj` (**Thomas**)

## Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

**TODO:**
1. Look at bottlenecks in existing code (**Tomi, Børre**)
    1. done - solved
1. Look at xfst ways of doing it (**Sjur, Trond, ...**)
    1. done for verbs
1. add derivations to the PLX generation (**Tomi**)
    1. done
1. add `gt/cwb/paradigm.smj.txt` file into `gt/script/server_anl.pl`
  (**Saara**)
1. add prefixes to the PLX (**Børre**)
1. middle nouns (**Børre**)
1. add Makefile target for PLX conversion of lexc files (**Tomi**):
    1. adjectives
    1. nouns
    1. propernouns
    1. verbs derived into other POSes
    1. verbs - must be done on gtsvn.uit.no
        1. produced by the paradigm server on victorio? or regenerate every night, and
    make it available for regular download? (**Tomi, Saara**)
1. make conversion test sample; add conversion testing to the make file
  (**Tomi**)
1. improve number conversion (**Børre, Tomi**)

## Public Beta release

Due to the problems with generating the PLX files discussed above, we need to
move the release date further. End of March?

Linguistic issues still open:
* prefixes (eahpe, ii-) (**Børre**)
* middle nouns (LEXICON: lexc: Rmiddle, plx: L) (**Børre**)

**DONE:**
* delivered PLX data of `sme` and `smj` including compounding
* translated Windows installer to `sme` and `smj`
* installed PLX compiler in G5 at `/usr/local/bin/mklex*` (one version for
  `sme` and one for `smj`)
* added resources needed for compiling PLX lexicons to our cvs repo
* tested the beta drop from Polderland - good we did, it is absolutely
  unacceptable (our responsibiliby - only linguistic errors (poor coverage)
  found so far)
* questions for Polderland:
    - version info in the speller
    - remaking/updating the installer packages with linguistic updates
* add compilation of MS Office spellers part of the Makefile
* install Windows and MS Office; test tools on Windows

**TODO:**
* improved `smj` speller (incl. derivations and compounds) (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* finish press release (**Sjur**)
* add info to front page (incl. download links) (**Børre**)
* write separate page with detailed info (incl. download links) (**Børre**)
* collect a list of PR recipients, forward to Berit Karen Paulsen
  (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)

## Version identification of speller lexicons

See the Norwegian spellers for an example, with the trigger string `tfosgniL`.

Suggestion:
```
nuvviD -> Divvun
nuvviD -> Dávvisámegiella
nuvviD -> Veršuvdna_1.0b1 (based on cvs tag?)
nuvviD -> 12.2.2007  (automatically generated/added)
nuvviD -> Sjur_Nørstebø_Moshagen
nuvviD -> Børre_Gaup
nuvviD -> Thomas_Omma
nuvviD -> Maaren_Palismaa
nuvviD -> Tomi_Pieski
nuvviD -> Trond_Trosterud
nuvviD -> Saara_Huhmarniemi
nuvviD -> Steinar_Nilsen
nuvviD -> Lene_Antonsen
nuvviD -> Linda_Wiechetek
```

These correction rules (and their corresponding PLX entries) should be added
automatically to the PLX file and the phonetic file as part of the compilation
process, to include build date and version number.

**TODO:**
* add version info to the generated speller lexicons (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)

# 10. Other

## Project meeting IRL

Reserve the whole week after easter for a project gathering, probably in
Kåfjord. That is, the days 10-13.4.

## Corpus contracts

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra as open-source on NoDaLi-sta
  (**Sjur**)
    - **delayed** until the public beta is out the door

## Updates:

* MacOS: 10.4.9
* SubEthaEdit: 2.6.2

## Bug fixing

**48** open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and **23** risten.no bugs

# 11. Next meeting, closing

The next meeting is 26.3.2007, 09:30 Norwegian time.

The meeting was closed at 11:36.
