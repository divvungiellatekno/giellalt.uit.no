  (**Børre, Sjur**)

# 4. Corpus infrastructure

Nothing.

# 5. Infrastructure

Bugzilla is up and running again.

**TODO:**
* add Jabber account in iChat (**all**)

# 6. Linguistics

## North Sámi

**TODO:**
* fix hyphenation of derivations (**Thomas, Tomi, Sjur, Trond**)
    - now tested, and much improved, but still needs improvements and further
   investigation
* fix circularity issue (**Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)
    - **Tomi** fixed it

## Lule Sámi

**TODO:**
* lexicalise words from the Olavi missing list, but check against the pdf
  original where in doubt (**Per-Eric**)
    - almost finished - only parts of the letter *r* still missing
* `sme->smj` lexicon conversion to build bilingual lexicon resources, and
  increase `smj` coverage (**Trond, Thomas, Svenne**)
* look at missing baseforms (**Thomas**)
    - done

# 7. Name lexicon infrastructure

This sub-project needs to get up and running soon. Mainly **Sjur's** task.

Decisions made in Tromsø can be found in [this meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

**TODO:**
1. set up Tomcat and risten.no on the G5 again (**Sjur, Børre**)
    1. install risten.no
        1. really tried, but got problems
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# 8. Proofing tools

1. Follow-up support for the sami languages in OpenOffice.org (**Børre, Sjur**)
    1. done, scheduled for version 2.4
1. Hunspell lexicon conversion (**Tomi, Børre**)
    1. improved, nouns compile much improved, adjectives also converts, but with
   errors, verbs are quite rough

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

This will wait till after the release.

**TODO:**
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)
* move **Steinar's** error markup in the xml files to (a copy of) the original
  (**Børre, Kimme**)
* add nested error markup to xml conversion (**Saara**)
* test new and nested error markup (**Sjur**)

### Automated testing

**TODO:**
* add hyphenation testing (**Sjur**)
    - rough version added
* improve paradigm testing report (**Sjur**)
    - done

### MS Office

An important aspect of this testing is to document in the user guide anything
that could be a problem for users.

**TODO:**
* test the proofing tools with all MS Office applications (**Børre, Thomas**)

## Lexicon conversion to the PLX format

PLX conversion update: we will soon get an updated speller engine with flags for
marking word-initial, word-internal and word-final positions. That will make it
possible for us to resolve some outstanding issues in the PLX conversion.

Open issues based on test results:

### smj
482 - still problematic (prefix), 484 - double hyphens suggested; 552 - now fixed!, Svierigadárogielan - still rejected (prefix)

### sme
397 - double hyphens (name+name), 419, 425 - roman
number, 431 - does not accept the correct string, but DO suggest the same; also hyphen final forms are accepted, but not the same form when part of a compound, 452 - *miel* is a prefix, 461 - *ovda* accepted, almost 50 %
(17) gets correct suggestion, 489, 522, 524, Guovdageainnu-láđđi not accepted.
```
Guovdageaidnu-láđđi  nom-
Guovdageainnu-láđđi  gen-
```
It should be Guovdageaidnu-láđđi OR Guovdageainnu láđđi. The first one is
suggested + Guovdageainnutláđđi

*Harstad-biila* (nom) is ok, whereas gen. *Harstada-biila* is not, ie the
same pattern.
```
ovda-
ovda-	ovda+Cmpnd
```

**TODO:**
* look at test cases still not behaving properly (**Thomas, Tomi**)

## InDesign tools

**TODO:**
* add hyphenation testing (**Sjur**)
    - done but not finished

## Hyphenators

We should look into the possibility of generating pattern-based hyphenation for
OOo. It shouldn't be too hard, or require too much work, but needs
investigation. => Divvun2.

**TODO:**
* get command line hyphenator (**Sjur**)
    - done

**TODO:**
