# Pedagogical software online

Meeting memos can be found at
[http://giellatekno.uit.no/ped/index.html#Meeting+memos]

Progress:

* /oahpa/morfa/ (sme)
* /oahpa/leksa/ (sme)
* /oahpa/logut/ (sme, smj, sma, smn!)

We have working beta versions on morphology (morfa), vocabulary (leksa) and
numerals (logut).

The urls are not published yet, they are still unstable (Saara takes them
down on irregular intervals in order to improve it, but they are actually
working. The morfa drill now works only in a "for lingusts" version, we will
give a further option with linguistic clues. Also the interface language
optionality is not quite working yet.

Goal for the Hattfjelldal meeting:
Have a sma morfa game ready for the verbs in the Verbh book

**TODO:**
* get the content ready (**Lene**)
* implement the UI and functionality (**Saara**)
* get an easy-to-remember URL (**UiT/IT**)
* More thorough skin, layout, ... (**External person within the Ped team**,
  **Internal forrest expert**) This we will postponed until later
* Make a pedagogical speller (**Tomi** when finished with his MA thesis)
    - Turn off peripheral compounds (numbers, acros, perhaps names)
    - Increase editing distance by one for suggestions? Only possible with limited
   compounding

# Documentation

**TODO:**
* start to reorganise the documentation (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)

# Corpus gathering

Trond has received two Turi texts (Muitalus+), and will add them.

**TODO:**
* follow up on `sma` corpus texts (**Sjur, Jovsset**)
* follow-up on the `smj` texts from **Kurt Tore** (**Per-Eric**)
* other contacts: Nord-Salten avis (**Børge Strandskog**), Lena Davidsson
  daughter to Lars-Matto Tuolja
* Put the list of possible corpus sources into a document
  `gt/doc/lang/sma/sma-corpus-plan.jspwiki` (**Maaren**)
* give contract with blank fields to **Per-Eric** (**Børre**)
* plan a `smj` pr tour for our tools (**Per-Eric, Thomas**)

# Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in `plan/strat/5year.jspwiki`.

# Infrastructure

To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):
1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
1. migrate to svn
1. merge gt, kt and st into one, probably after the svn move
1. more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
1. close certain parts of the code repository (requires svn)
1. set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
    1. permanent chat rooms
    1. stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
    1. iCal server / group calendars
    1. wiki
1. wiki? (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
1. improve Forrest stability and i18n support
1. reorganise the documentation content:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. Apertium for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. Open POSes (Komi as a test case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. sfst? Both as replacement for xfst and for hunspell/open-source proofing tools
1. investigate the NSIS installer, potentially replacing the InstallShield
  package from Polderland
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories?

**TODO:**
* add CG regression test (**Lene, Sjur, Trond**)
    - done, at least a reasonable start.
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - not yet - depends on the prevous point
* define and document testing routines (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - started
* add Jabber account in iChat
    - UiT: Lene, Kimme, Saara (**Trond**)
* prepare migration to svn (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - https access is now working.
   svn checkout https://gtsvn.uit.no/repos
* try to repair G5 accounts for iCal Server (**Børre**)

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

**TODO:**
* `sme->smj` lexicon conversion to build bilingual lexicon resources, and
  increase `smj` coverage (**Trond, Svenne**).
* Add the words when all words are ready.

## South Sámi

**Jovsset** will ask the authors whether we can get a copy of the Verbh
manuscript in electronic version, with the usual corpus contract.

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

**TODO:**
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

Updated version now available at the Divvun download area
[http://www.divvun.no/static_files/sme-nob-dict.zip].

What we have works, content-wise and technically, for Mac OS 10.5. Technically,
the challenge now is to port it to other OS-es, and generalise the
infrastructure to make it easy to add new dictionaries without doubling the
infrastructure components.

The linguistic challenges are:

* Compounds (must be lexicalised)
* Derivations (must be lexicalised)
* Better coverage (the `words/dicts/smenob/src/inc-*` files)
* Better dictionary aricles

As for the last point, we are considering a dictionary workshop next winter. But
we will then need lexicographers, and routines for using our tools and parallel
corpora for finding dictionary examples.

**TODO:**
* clean up and generalise the make infrastructure
* make Linux and Windows versions
* make simple installer applications
* make a public release
    - Make a homepage with instructions for dictionary use:
   `xtdoc/gtuit/src/documentation/content/xdocs/dict.eng.xml`
    - Clarify the difference between local and online dictionaries:
        - Plugin for Firefox and Internet Explorer (online dictionaries)
        - Integrated dictionary for Mac 10.5 (local ones), in the future also Windows
    and Linux

# Proofing tools

## Hunspell

Latest test results now committed and linked to.

**Børre** is working on the conversion.

```
sme.dic 12MB
sme.aff 873kB
smj.dic 17MB
smj.aff 484kB
```

These files are in 129.242.220.111 /Users/boerre/gt/tmp
http://divvun.no/static_files/hunspell-se-2008-05-23.zip

Installation (needs the last version of OpenOffice.org 2.4)

Under linux the files se.dic and se.aff must be copied to
/usr/share/myspell/dicts/

In OS X the folder is
/Applications/OpenOffice.org.app/Contents/share/dict/ooo/

Then these lines should be added to the following file:

in Linux:
/usr/share/myspell/dicts/dictionary.lst

in Mac:
/Applications/OpenOffice.org.app/Contents/share/dict/ooo/dictionary.lst

```
DICT se NO se
DICT se SE se
DICT se FI se
DICT smj NO smj
DICT smj SE smj
```

**TODO:**
1. add `smj` to the soup, make sure it works roughly as good as `sme`
    1. added, needs to be tested
        1. both sme and smj need to be tested now using Gold Standard tests (**Sjur**)
1. make a proper Linux distro (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. give test Linux distro to Petter Reinholdtsen on Wednesday (**Børre, Sjur**)
1. look into other distro's as well: Mac, Windows (**Børre, Sjur, ...**)
1. write README file, it should say BETA (**Børre, Sjur**)
1. write installation and usage instructions (online, and in distro)
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
1. QA README and installation docs (**Trond, Per-Eric**)
1. translate readme, installation docu (all)
1. release a public beta at the end of May (**Børre, Sjur**)
1. fix the remaining conversion bugs (**Børre, Tomi**)

## Testing
