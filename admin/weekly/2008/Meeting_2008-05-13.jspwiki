# Pedagogical software online

Still more progress, probably online demo this or next month.

**TODO:**
* get the content ready (**Lene**)
* implement the UI and functionality (**Saara**)

    - Turn off peripheral compounds (numbers, acros, perhaps names)
    - Increase editing distance by one for suggestions? Only possible with limited
   compounding

# Documentation

**TODO:**
* start to reorganise the documentation (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)

# Corpus gathering

After some discussion, we decided that **Thomas** and **Per-Eric** should do a
*tour de Divvun* in the Lule Sámi area, to make more people use our tools, and
provide us with more texts, and to make them understand that using our tools is
beneficial even for *professional* writers.

**Per-Eric** talked to **Børge Strandskog** (*Nord-Salten avis*), to remind
him about our work and need for `smj` texts.

**TODO:**
* follow up on `sma` corpus texts (**Sjur, Jovsset**)
* follow-up on the `smj` texts from **Kurt Tore** (**Per-Eric**)
* get texts from **Sigga Tuolja Sandstrøm**, possibly through
  **Ulf-Stefan Winka**
  (contract is ok now) (**Per-Eric**)
* other contacts: Nord-Salten avis (**Børge Strandskog**), Lena Davidsson
  daughter to Lars-Matto Tuolja
* Put the list of possible corpus sources into a document
  `gt/doc/lang/sma/sma-corpus-plan.jspwiki` (**Maaren**)
* give contract with blank fields to **Per-Eric** (**Børre**)
* plan a `smj` pr tour for our tools (**Per-Eric, Thomas**)

# Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in `plan/strat/5year.jspwiki`.

# Infrastructure

To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):
1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
1. migrate to svn
1. merge gt, kt and st into one, probably after the svn move
1. more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
1. close certain parts of the code repository (requires svn)
1. set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
    1. permanent chat rooms
    1. stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
    1. iCal server / group calendars
    1. wiki
1. wiki? (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
1. improve Forrest stability and i18n support
1. reorganise the documentation content:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. Apertium for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. Open POSes (Komi as a test case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. sfst? Both as replacement for xfst and for hunspell/open-source proofing tools
1. investigate the NSIS installer, potentially replacing the InstallShield
  package from Polderland
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories?

**TODO:**
* add CG regression test (**Lene, Sjur, Trond**)
    - needs to be integrated in the make file
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - not yet - depends on the prevous point
* define and document testing routines (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - not yet
* add Jabber account in iChat
    - UiT: Lene, Kimme, Saara (**Trond**)
* prepare migration to svn (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - https access is now working.
   svn checkout https://gtsvn.uit.no/repos
* try to repair G5 accounts for iCal Server (**Børre**)

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

**TODO:**
* `sme->smj` lexicon conversion to build bilingual lexicon resources, and
  increase `smj` coverage (**Trond, Svenne**). 
* Add the words when all words are ready.

## South Sámi

Nothing new since last week.

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

Updated the eXist version, reinstalled all data. The G5 installation should work
again now.

**TODO:**
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

**TODO:**

* find similar frameworks for Linux and Windows
    - StarDict - opensource, free, can take XML dictionaries, all OS-es
* make simple installer applications
* make a public release
    - Make a homepage with instructions for dictionary use:
   `xtdoc/gtuit/src/documentation/content/xdocs/dict.eng.xml`
    - Clarify the difference between local and online dictionaries:
        - Plugin for Firefox and Internet Explorer (online dictionaries)
        - Integrated dictionary for Mac 10.5 (local ones), in the future also Windows
    and Linux

# Proofing tools

## Hunspell

**Børre** finally found a working strategy for converting our lexc lexicons to
hunspell format.

**TODO:**
1. test latest lexicon (**Sjur**)
1. add `smj` to the soup, make sure it works roughly as good as `sme`
  (**Børre, Thomas, Per-Eric**)
    1. added to derivations, needs to be tested
1. fix the remaining conversion bugs for `sme` (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. return to `smj`, and fix whatever is left to fix (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. release a public beta at the end of April (**Børre, Sjur**)

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)
