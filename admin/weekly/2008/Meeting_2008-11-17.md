# Corpus gathering

We presently have 113 253 words in the `sma` corpus:

```
~$ccat -l sma -a -r gt/zcorp/bound/sma/ | preprocess | wc -l
109 304
~$ccat -l sma -a -r gt/zcorp/free/sma/ | preprocess | wc -l
  3 949
```

This is too little, but is probably good enough at the moment. What is coming
soon is OCR-scanned texts by Ella Holm Bull (all children contacted, they have
said *yes*) and Anna Jakobsen. Also news transcripts from SR and NRK are in
the pipeline, awaiting the final yes from only one author. That should improve
the situation.

**TODO:**
* continue gathering `sma` corpus texts (**David, Jovsset**)
* transfer the `smj` texts by **Kurt Tore** and **Ulf Stefan Winka** to our
  corpus repository (**Per-Eric**)
* other contacts: Lena Davidsson, daughter to Lars-Matto Tuolja
* make a 1-page, light version of the contract, also in Swedish
  (**Børre, David, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed till we have some more time
* discuss infra improvements for corpus rep administration (**Børre, Ciprian**)
    - delayed till we are done with the `gt/Makefile` improvements
* gather the `smj` texts from *Nord-Salten avis* (online archive)
  (**Thomas**)

# Promoting Divvun

**TODO:**
* Make a download log (**Børre**)
* use a newspaper or something to write about the tools from an end-user point
  of view (a review in *Š, Ávvir*?)
    - follow-up *Ávvir* project interview (**Thomas**)
    - follow-up *Š* (**Thomas**)
* consider the best way to inform potential users in Sweden about the Divvun
  tools (**David**)
    - **David** has suggested to announce in *Sáminuorat* and *Samefolket*
    - preferably get an article in the papers at the same time, about the project
   and the tools
    - make an add for our tools to go into newspapers (**David, Jovsset**)
* Prepare for a coordinated info campaign when Ped is ready (inform teachers
  about Divvun as well as Ped when we inform about Ped) - next year
* conduct Tour de Divvun (`smj` info tour) (**Thomas, Per-Eric**)
    - ask **Leif Åge** to burn & print some CD's (**Thomas**)
        - got the CD's
* make leaflet to inform about the project (**Jovsset, David**)
    - talk to **John Markus Kuhmunen** for tips, (**Jovsset**)
    - `sme` translation of main text (**Thomas**) - DONE
    - `fin` translation (**Tomi**) - partially done
    - add link to OOo installation and usage instructions (**Sjur**)
    - improve OOo instructions (**Børre**)
    - add Linux info (**Børre**)
    - add InDesign text (**Sjur**) - requires installer
    - review the Windows pictures, and usage instructions for MS Office 2003
   (**Jovsset**)
        - screenshots (**Børre**)
        - text (**Jovsset**)
    - make bilingual Word-version for the Divvun tour in **Divtasvuodna**
    (**Thomas, Sjur**)
        - done
* distribute CD version through the library bus, the language centres and common
  sami centres in all of Sápmi. Gaaltije in Östersund for example.
  (**Leif Åge, Jovsset**)
* contact MS Nordic, and ask them to include the Divvun tools in the next Office
  releases (both Windows and Mac). The integration can/should be done by
  Polderland, which is an official MS subcontractor/integrator. It could be used
  by MS as part of their advertising for the next releases, and it will make it
  much easier for people to get access to the tools. (**Sjur**)

# Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in `plan/strat/5year.jspwiki`.

# Infrastructure
To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
    1. test bench enhanced, but not yet complet
1. set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
    1. permanent chat rooms
    1. stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
    1. iCal server / group calendars
    1. wiki
1. wiki? on G5 (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
1. improve Forrest stability and i18n support ( the divvun crashes)
    1. **Sjur** has been working on better i18n and pdf rendering
    1. **Børre** has some ideas for getting back to serving static html files
1. reorganise the documentation:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium](http://www.apertium.org/) and 
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. sfst?
    1. replacement for xfst -> see [omorf
| http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/kieliteknologia/tutkimus/omor/index.shtml],
   [omorf wiki](https://kitwiki.csc.fi/twiki/bin/view/KitWiki/HfstHome) and
   [omorfi](https://gna.org/projects/omorfi)
    1. replacement for hunspell/open-source proofing tools
1. investigate the [NSIS installer](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page),
  potentially replacing the InstallShield
  package from Polderland
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
1. update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

SVN issues:
* http access not yet available (https only at the moment, but it works as
  anonymous checkout if the user is *not* specified)
* read access to the whole repo is working, BUT:
    - `gt/*/polderland` should be protected
    - `plan` should be protected
* certain users need to be on the UiT VPN to be able to commit (bug #705)
* UTF-8 problem in svn commit mails: the commit log text is garbled

**TODO:**
* infrastructure remake: (**Børre, Ciprian, Saara, Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)
    - more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
        - meeting Wednesday at 9.30 Norw. time
    - merge gt, kt and st into one
    - modularised preprocess and spellrelax
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* define and document testing routines (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* follow-up migration to svn:
    - close the open SVN repository at requested paths (**Ciprian**)
        - completely closed at the moment, until we have solved the path-based control
    - prepare and discuss with external users: Jack Ruether (**Trond**)
* setup iCal Server (on XServe) (**Børre**)
    - depends on the G5 returning
* repair the G5 (**Børre**)
    - still waiting for the machine to be repaired

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=711

## Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

**TODO:**
* `sme->smj` lexicon conversion to build bilingual lexicon resources, and
  increase `smj` coverage (**Trond**). 
* Add the words when all words are ready.

## South Sámi

**TODO:**
* integrate adjectives into the analyser, without morphology as a starting point
  (**David, Trond, Sjur**)
    - first round done
* finish reformulating the noun grammar like the verbs (**David, Sjur, Trond**)
    - done except for proper nouns
* prepare a workshop on South Sámi orthography and grammar (**David**)
    - date: last week of February (23.-27.) seems to work fine with SGL/South Sámi
    branch
    - we'll cover travel and hotel expenses
    - we'll invite both SGL and as many of the other key persons in the `sma`
   writing/normativity community as possible
    - set up a preliminary agenda (**David, Sjur**)
    - prepare data for each topic (**David, Sjur, Trond**)
    - make a folder to collect all relevant documents and data (**David, Sjur**)
* clean the `smanob` data (**Trond** with some help)

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

From the meeting with the terminology and IT teams last week:
* no major rework on the present search interface now
* no work on the editing section; instead:
* add existing lists of sanctioned terminology as separate term entities
* add a dictionary if we can make one with sufficient quality

This means the following tasks:
* find already approved lists, in paper or electronic form (**term team**)
* convert paper lists to electronic lists (**term team**)
* convert lists to standard XML (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add prepared lists to risten.no (**Sjur, Tomi**)

**TODO:**
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add `nob`
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

**Ciprian** is working hard on it.

**TODO:**
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* make simple installer applications
* make a public release
    - Make a homepage with instructions for dictionary use:
   `xtdoc/gtuit/src/documentation/content/xdocs/dict.eng.xml`
    - Clarify the difference between local and online dictionaries:
        - Plugin for Firefox and Internet Explorer (online dictionaries)
* Contact Davvi Girji about cooperation on electronic dictionaries (**Sjur**)
* short meeting to go through missing points before a release
  (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)

# Proofing tools

## Hunspell

**TODO:**
* check the hunspell test bench and tokenization errors (**Børre, Sjur**)
* implement an easter egg (almost) identical to the Polderland one (**Børre**)
* fine tune suggestions (**Børre, Thomas**)

## OpenXSpell

Working everywhere (almost) in MacOS X applications, provides Sámi spell
checking system-wide through a hunspell back-end.
[OpenXSPell](http://www.cygnusblack.co.uk/openxspell/index.html)

There are two issues:
* strings with non-ASCII chars are always flagged
* asking for suggestions on words witn non-ASCII chars crashes OpenXSpell

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)
* test new and nested error markup (**Sjur**)
    - nesting still needs to be tested, depends on new `ccat` feature

### Speller testing

**TODO:**
* check ccat, whether it allows specification of error type to be extracted or
  considered when doing gold-standard testing (**Tomi**)

## Speller updates

**TODO:**
* compile new spellers (**Tomi**)

## Speller bugs

## Sámi week in Tromsø

**Sigbjørn Skåden** has asked the UiT gang to demonstrate etc at the Tromsø city
Library as a part of that week and the happenings at the Library. The week
around February 6th (February 2-8). Sounds like a good idea, we will be there.

* ped tools
* Sámi dictionaries
* Sámi proofing tools
* other things?

## Sámi allaskuvla conference

**Trond** and **Lene** *presented* UiT (instead of discussing cooperation
possibilities). All attendees were using our speller:)

SA emphasises the use of electronic tools as part of the pedagogical tool chest.

The administration was not there, thus no discussion on cooperation on texts for
the corpus.

The presentations went well, with very interested people - cooperation seems to
go well between Giellatekno and Divvun. Questions after all presentations. There
are still problems with compounds, suggested to use semantic information to
improve the behaviour.

A reporter from Ávvir asked some questions to Tomi and Linda. Tomi asked them to
make a feature article on the use of the Divvun tools, and the reporter pointed
to a journalist working in Tromsø.

**TODO:**
* translate presentation, present it (**Tomi**)
    - done with good results :)

## Text to speech

Recording is done (Biret Ánne the local hero), the first alpha, or rather the
quality is so good let us call it a beta has been made (Antti the Helsinki
hero). Next step is to take one more round on improvements and do one rerun
before the Sámediggi october meeting.

Antti has hinted at the possibility of doing beta versions of other 
languages as well. We are thus now recording Greenlandic sentences. A further
possibility would be smj, sma, this would require phon-smX.xfst files for
these languages as well (a couple of days' work for smj, more for sma), plus
recording.

**TODO:**
* Make a second round of improvements.
* Consider more languages (pro-et-con for all-in-one-step vs.
  one banana fly first, the optimal choice is not obvious).

## Corpus contracts + open source

Postponed until the svn repository is fully functional (it is too open now).

# Next meeting, closing

The next meeting is 24.11.2008, 9.30 Norwegian time.

**Sjur** will be in Stockholm Thursday and Friday, and present the speller test
bench.

The meeting was closed at 11:28.
