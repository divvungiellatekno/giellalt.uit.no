# Pedagogical software online

Meeting memos can be found at
[http://giellatekno.uit.no/ped/index.html#Meeting+memos]

**TODO:**
* implement the UI and functionality (**Saara**)
* get an easy-to-remember URL (**UiT/IT**)
* More thorough skin, layout, ... (**External person within the Ped team**,
  **Internal forrest expert**) This we will postponed until later

# Corpus gathering

**David** added one book, originally in Swedish, translated into `sma` as well
as `sme` and `smj`. Added `sma` text, will add original, and will ask for
permission to add thnowe other two translations as well.

Contract feedback: the contract is too long, and too heavy. We need a short, or
"light", version of the contract.

Processing steps for Sámi-Norwegian place name pairs from SK:
* convert to xml - retain all data, and a source mark (conversion script in both
  directions?)
* include in:
    - bilingual dictionaries
    - risten.no
    - monolingual transducers
    - subset in ped games (manual selection)
* add inflection etc (using existing data)

**TODO:**
* continue gathering `sma` corpus texts (**David, Jovsset**)
    - some gathered, sent in through the home page
* follow-up on the `smj` texts from **Kurt Tore** (**Per-Eric**)
    - send an e-mail and ask for status (**Thomas**)
        - done
* other contacts: *Nord-Salten avis* (**Børge Strandskog**), Lena Davidsson
  daughter to Lars-Matto Tuolja
* **Ulf Stefan Winka** has a lot of `smj` texts (**Per-Eric**)
    - **Thomas** has discussed this with **Per-Eric**
* plan a `smj` pr tour for our tools (**Per-Eric, Thomas**)
* meet with the Sámi publishers (meeting delayed) (**Jovsset**)
* add incoming `sma` texts to the corpus rep (**Børre, Ciprian**)
    - Ciprian would like to add some more automatisation to the corpus processing
* make a 1-page, light version of the contract, also in Swedish
  (**Børre, David, Sjur, Trond**)
* fix the *Upload more* link (**Børre**)

# Promoting Divvun

**Thomas** and **Tomi** were at Rica Hotell Tromsø last week, presenting the
Divvun project for the SGL (Norwegian normative group, all but `sma` was
represented). They were very positively surprised, and seemed interested. They
even wanted to send texts to us.

Learning experience for us: even informed people do not really get what it is
all about until we meet them. Which means that we need to meet more people, to
get more people to use our tools and to send us texts.

**Thomas** talked about the normative work, especially the `smj` normative
work. It is very unclear how loanwords should be normalised. Mentioned that
he had made some decisions himself (with clear examples), and got positive
response on that.

**TODO:**
* Make a download log (**Børre**)
    - nothing new
* use a newspaper or something to write about the tools from an end-user point
  of view (a review in Š, Ávvir, Nordsalten avis?)
    - **Tomi's** contact in Finland has too much work, but suggested
   **Astrid Helander** at *Ávvir* instead. (**Thomas**)
* consider the best way to inform potential users in Sweden about the Divvun
  tools (**David**)
    - **David** has suggested to announce in *Sáminuorat* and *Samefolket*
    - preferably get an article in the papers at the same time, about the project
   and the tools
* Prepare for a coordinated info campaign when Ped is ready (inform teachers
  about Divvun as well as Ped when we inform about Ped) - next year
* Tour de Divvun (smj info tour) (**Thomas, Per-Eric**)
    - fix the date
    - make sure the leaflet is ready (see below)
    - bring some CD's
* make leaflet to inform about the project (**Jovsset**)
    - first draft available at
   `xtdoc/sd/src/documentation/content/xdocs/leaflet/leaflet.sv.jspwiki` as
   well as
   [http://www.divvun.no/leaflet/leaflet.sv.html]
    - translate text when it is finished (**Thomas, Jovsset**)
* distribute CD version through the library bus, the language centres and common
  sami centres in all of Sápmi. Gaaltije in Östersund for example.
  (**Leif Åge, Jovsset**)
* contact MS Nordic, and ask them to include the Divvun tools in the next Office
  releases (both Windows and Mac). The integration can/should be done by
  Polderland, which is an official MS subcontractor/integrator. It could be used
  by MS as part of their advertising for the next releases, and it will make it
  much easier for people to get access to the tools. (**Sjur**)

# Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in `plan/strat/5year.jspwiki`.

# Infrastructure
To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
    1. test bench enhanced, but not yet complete
1. more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
1. merge gt, kt and st into one
1. set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
    1. permanent chat rooms
    1. stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
    1. iCal server / group calendars
    1. wiki
1. wiki? on G5 (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
1. improve Forrest stability and i18n support ( the divvun crashes)
    1. **Sjur** has been working on better i18n and pdf rendering
    1. **Børre** has some ideas for getting back to serving static html files
1. reorganise the documentation:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium](http://www.apertium.org/) and
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. sfst?
    1. replacement for xfst -> see [omorf
| http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/kieliteknologia/tutkimus/omor/index.shtml],
   [omorf wiki](https://kitwiki.csc.fi/twiki/bin/view/KitWiki/HfstHome) and
   [omorfi](https://gna.org/projects/omorfi)
    1. replacement for hunspell/open-source proofing tools
1. investigate the [NSIS installer](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page),
  potentially replacing the InstallShield
  package from Polderland
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
1. update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

SVN issues:
* http access not yet available (https only at the moment, but it works as
  anonymous checkout if the user is *not* specified)
* read access to the whole repo is working, BUT:
    - `gt/*/polderland` should be protected
    - `plan` should be protected
* everything will be google-able by default if the repo URL is posted
* certain users need to be on the UiT VPN to be able to commit (bug #705)
* UTF-8 problem in svn commit mails: the commit log text is garbled

**TODO:**
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* define and document testing routines (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* follow-up migration to svn:
    - close the open SVN repository at requested paths (**Ciprian**)
    - prepare and discuss with external users: Jack Ruether (**Trond**)
* setup iCal Server (on XServe) (**Børre**)
    - working on it
* repair the G5 (**Børre**)
    - received one e-mail asking for whether it is ok to format the disk

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=711

## Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

**TODO:**
* `sme->smj` lexicon conversion to build bilingual lexicon resources, and
  increase `smj` coverage (**Trond**).
* Add the words when all words are ready.

## South Sámi

**TODO:**
* get the *Verbh* manuscript in electronic form (**Jovsset**)
    - we give up, although we would welcome an answer
* get an overview over all problematic areas of the orthography (**David**)
    - done as far as has been possible - a call to Lajla Mattsson-Magga confirmed
   the findings so far (ie mostly word lists have been handled, the only
   orthographic decision has been a partial decision on how to spell foreign
   words)
* type the verbs in manually (to be written into verb-lex-sma.txt: the
  odd-syllabic only, now at dïjmedidh on p. 113). The verbs to be added
  are the ones with p. 76
    - 113-130  (**David**)
        - done
    - 131-145  (**Jovsset**)
        - done
    - 146-160  (**Linda**, **Sjur** as backup -> **Thomas**)
        - done 3 pages
    - 161-175  (**Thomas**)
        - done
    - 176-190  (**Tomi**)
        - done (by **Thomas**)
    - 191-205  (**Trond**)
        - done
* ask **Maja** for the adjectives (**Trond**)
    - done, it is ok to use them
* integrate adjectives into the analyser, without morphology as a starting point
  (**Trond, Sjur**)
* reformulate the noun grammar like the verbs (**Sjur, Trond**)

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

**TODO:**
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add `nob`
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

`nob-sme` dictionary works, ie compilation and building works as it should.
Ciprian has also solved the paradigm generation issue on his computer, which
means morphological intelligence should be back in `sme-nob`.

To get the paradigm generation working, clean everything and make a new automata
and it should work.

September:
* content revision of smenob:
    - split in noun, propernoun, adj, verb, other
    - make better content
* fix the frontend issue (windows, linux)
    - Evaluate dictionary providers (Stardict, ...)
    - Platform?

**TODO:**
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* clean up and generalise the make infrastructure
* improve Linux and Windows local/integrated versions
* make simple installer applications
* make a public release
    - Make a homepage with instructions for dictionary use:
   `xtdoc/gtuit/src/documentation/content/xdocs/dict.eng.xml`
    - Clarify the difference between local and online dictionaries:
        - Plugin for Firefox and Internet Explorer (online dictionaries)
* Contact Davvi Girji about cooperation on electronic dictionaries (**Sjur**)

# Proofing tools

## Hunspell

In our process to make hunspell tools, `makealias`, a script that compacts the
hunspell dictionaries, has been incorporated (`makealias` is a shell script
available as part of the source distribution). The resulting files seem to crash
OO.org 3.0rcX at least on Windows and OS X.

The same files work well on OO.org 2.4 on Linux and Windows, and also as
systemwide spellcheckers for both Gnome and KDE4 applications.
Using the non-compacted hunspell dictionaries on OS X and OO.org 3.0 works well.
On Windows (in a virtual machine and 256MB RAM) and OO.org 3.0, the spelling
process stalls, probably due to too little RAM. **Børre** will test it again
with more RAM.

**TODO:**
* QA README and installation docs - report (**Trond**)
* test the latest hunspell speller files (**Sjur**)
* check the hunspell test bench and tokenization errors (**Børre, Sjur**)
* make extension packages of the spellers (**Børre**)
* test installations on all platforms (**Børre**)
* fine tune suggestions (**Børre, Thomas**)

## OpenXSpell

Working everywhere (almost) in MacOS X applications, provides Sámi spell
checking system-wide through a hunspell back-end. The main problem is that it
isn't yet UTF-8 safe. [OpenXSPell](http://www.cygnusblack.co.uk/openxspell/index.html)

**TODO:**
* fix the UTF-8 bug

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)
* test new and nested error markup (**Sjur**)

### Speller testing

We need a test file for testing the speller behaviour on a defined set of word
constructions: compounds of all types, derivations, inflections, and
combinations of those.

**TODO:**
* make speller test file for word types (**Thomas**)
    - done
* create a new test case using the new data (**Sjur**)

## Speller updates

**TODO:**
* test the spellers (**Divvun team**)
* new make target for Office 2008 (**Sjur**)
    - progressing
* waiting for hyphenation updates for 2008 (**Polderland**)
    - received

## Speller bugs

## Text to speech

We are planning a North Sámi text to speech. Work on the text-to-transcription
(ttt) component has begun, and for the transcription-to-sound we cooperate with
U Hki. For a forthcoming october demo we have two alternative tracks:

1. Do the ttt with quasi-Finnish orthography as output, and plug it onto the
  Finnish ttt (the Sámi-as-a-Finnish-priest solution)  (pro: the web demo is
  there, so the demo is within reach; con: several phonemes are missing)
1. Do the ttt with SAMPA as output, and read in 200 sentences, and have Hki
  generate a voice based upon that (pro: probably better result, head start on
  the project; con: we risk that is not be done by
1. Do both in parallel. (pro: safety first, not much double work; con: well,
  the double work in the phon-sme.xfst file)

The best thing would probably be to do both tracks, to be on the safe side.
