  **Internal forrest expert**) This we will postpone until later

Nice workshop, very informative, several potential projects discussed with
multiple attendees. At first there will be a network initiative.

* start to reorganise the documentation (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)

# Corpus gathering

**TODO:**
* follow-up on the `smj` texts from **Kurt Tore** (**Per-Eric**)
* get texts from **Sigga Tuolja Sandstrøm**, possibly through **Olavi Korhonen**

* improve forrest stability with i18n, site look (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)
* set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support - permanent chat
  rooms, project calendar(s), wiki? (**Børre, Sjur**)

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

Hyphenation bugs still there, now properly documented by the improved test
bench.

## Lule Sámi

All missing lists now added. A few things missing from the bible texts.

Hyphenation: same as for `sme`.

**TODO:**
* `sme->smj` lexicon conversion to build bilingual lexicon resources, and
  increase `smj` coverage (**Trond, Svenne**).
* Add the words when all words are ready.

## South Sámi

**Tomi** has added even more verbs. The corrections to *Verbh* are now added to the lexicon. **Joseph** is hunting for `sma` texts at SD.

**TODO:**
* check the present sources (**Sjur, Trond**)
    - done

# Name lexicon infrastructure

**TODO:**
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
    1. it works ok locally, set-up / config needs to be checked on the G5; probably
   easy to fix
1. fix display in column 3 (**Sjur**)
    1. it works in Firefox and other Mozilla-based browsers; not in Safari and other
   Webkit-based browsers
        1. fixed
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

# Proofing tools

## Hunspell

The %> marker has been fixed, it was a bug in the homebuilt xml-parser.
Derivations seem to work, but no new lexicons due to technical problems.

**TODO:**
1. debug the missing > marker - the problem is on the Java side (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. add `smj` to the soup, make sure it works roughly as good as `sme`
1. fix the remaining conversion bugs for `sme`
1. return to `smj`, and fix whatever is left to fix
1. integrate the derivations as separate "continuation lexicons"
