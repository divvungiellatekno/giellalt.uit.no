   compounding

# Documentation

**TODO:**
* start to reorganise the documentation (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)

# Corpus gathering

We discussed how the last corpus contacts of **Per-Eric** could be followed up
either before he leaves the project, or by others in the project team.

**TODO:**
* follow up on `sma` corpus texts (**Sjur, Jovsset**)
* follow-up on the `smj` texts from **Kurt Tore** (**Per-Eric**)

  daughter to Lars-Matto Tuolja

* plan a `smj` pr tour for our tools (**Per-Eric, Thomas**)

# Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in `plan/strat/5year.jspwiki`.

# Infrastructure

To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):
1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
1. migrate to svn
1. merge gt, kt and st into one, probably after the svn move
1. more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
1. close certain parts of the code repository (requires svn)
1. set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
    1. permanent chat rooms
    1. stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
    1. iCal server / group calendars
    1. wiki
1. wiki? (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
1. improve Forrest stability and i18n support
1. reorganise the documentation content:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. Apertium for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. Open POSes (Komi as a test case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. sfst? Both as replacement for xfst and for hunspell/open-source proofing tools
1. investigate the NSIS installer, potentially replacing the InstallShield
  package from Polderland
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories?

**TODO:**
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* define and document testing routines (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* add Jabber account in iChat
    - UiT: Lene, Kimme, Saara (**Trond**)
* prepare migration to svn (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - https access is now working.
   svn checkout https://gtsvn.uit.no/repos
* try to repair G5 accounts for iCal Server (**Børre**)

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

**TODO:**
* `sme->smj` lexicon conversion to build bilingual lexicon resources, and
  increase `smj` coverage (**Trond, Svenne**).
* Add the words when all words are ready.

## South Sámi

**Jovsset** will ask the authors whether we can get a copy of the Verbh
manuscript in electronic version, with the usual corpus contract.

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

**TODO:**
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

**TODO:**
* clean up and generalise the make infrastructure
* make Linux and Windows local/integrated versions
* make simple installer applications
* make a public release
    - Make a homepage with instructions for dictionary use:
   `xtdoc/gtuit/src/documentation/content/xdocs/dict.eng.xml`
    - Clarify the difference between local and online dictionaries:
        - Plugin for Firefox and Internet Explorer (online dictionaries)

# Proofing tools

## Hunspell

**Børre** has compiled a new set of lexicons, now also including `smj`:

```
sme.dic  50 MB
sme.aff 873 kB
smj.dic  17 MB

```

These files are in 129.242.220.111 /Users/boerre/gt/tmp
http://divvun.no/static_files/hunspell-se-2008-05-23.zip

Under linux the files se.dic and se.aff must be copied to
/usr/share/myspell/dicts/

In OS X the folder is
/Applications/OpenOffice.org.app/Contents/share/dict/ooo/

Then these lines should be added to the following file:

in Linux:
/usr/share/myspell/dicts/dictionary.lst

in Mac:
/Applications/OpenOffice.org.app/Contents/share/dict/ooo/dictionary.lst

```
DICT se NO se
DICT se SE se
DICT se FI se
DICT smj NO smj
DICT smj SE smj

## Summer vacations

|   Who     | When
| --- | ---
|  Børre    | 30/6-6/7, 21/7-3/8, 11/8-17/8
|  Jovsset  | ???
|  Per-Eric | 11/6-30/6

## Divvun feedback

**Jovsset** was at the *Giellagiella* seminar last week, with language
workers. They knew very little about the Divvun project, and what we provide. We
need to inform better about ourselves and our "products".

# Next meeting, closing

The meeting was closed at 11:00.
