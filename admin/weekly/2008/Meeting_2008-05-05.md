# Pedagogical software online

Same as last week: working on it. **Saara** has a demo UI ready for vocabulary
games, but not online yet. **Lene** has worked a lot on the word lists.

We are considering a speller tied to the ped tools, with the lexicon consisting
of a predefined set of target words (say, a list ov beverages if asked for
what to drink, etc.), and a speller mechanism related to that list.
The speller mechanism here could actually be hunspell, as the infrastructure
will soon be in place, just include all and only the wanted words.

**TODO:**
* get the content ready (**Lene**)
* implement the UI and functionality (**Saara**)
* get an easy-to-remember URL (**UiT/IT**)
* More thorough skin, layout, ... (**External person within the Ped team**,
  **Internal forrest expert**) This we will postponed until later
* Make a pedagogical speller (**Tomi** when finished with his MA thesis)
    - Turn off peripheral compounds (numbers, acros, perhaps names)
    - Increase editing distance by one for suggestions? Only possible with limited
   compounding

# Documentation

**TODO:**
* start to reorganise the documentation (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)

# Corpus gathering

**Jovsset** has sent texts found at sametinget to **Børre**, mostly his own
texts. Still to be added to the corpus repository.

Nothing new regarding `smj` texts.

**TODO:**
* follow up on `sma` corpus texts (**Sjur, Jovsset**)
* follow-up on the `smj` texts from **Kurt Tore** (**Per-Eric**)
* get texts from **Sigga Tuolja Sandstrøm**, possibly through
  **Ulf-Stefan Winka**
  (contract is ok now) (**Per-Eric**)
* other contacts: Nord-Salten avis (**Børge Strandskog**), Lena Davidsson
  daughter to Lars-Matto Tuolja
* Put the list of possible corpus sources into a document
  `gt/doc/lang/sma/sma-corpus-plan.jspwiki` (**Maaren**)
* give contract with blank fields to **Per-Eric** (**Børre**)

# Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in `plan/strat/5year.jspwiki`.

# Infrastructure

**Lene** has worked on the CG test bench, including adding regression testing.

To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):
1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
1. migrate to svn
1. merge gt, kt and st into one, probably after the svn move
1. more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
1. close certain parts of the code repository (requires svn)
1. set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
    1. permanent chat rooms
    1. stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
    1. iCal server / group calendars
    1. wiki
1. wiki? (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
1. improve Forrest stability and i18n support
1. reorganise the documentation content:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. Apertium for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. Open POSes (Komi as a test case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. sfst? Both as replacement for xfst and for hunspell/open-source proofing tools
1. investigate the NSIS installer, potentially replacing the InstallShield
  package from Polderland
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories?

**TODO:**
* add CG regression test (**Lene, Sjur, Trond**)
    - in progress
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - not yet
* define and document testing routines (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - not yet
* add Jabber account in iChat
    - check that all accounts are ready for iChat on the G5 (**Børre**)
        - done
    - UiT: Lene, Kimme, Saara (**Trond**)
* prepare migration to svn (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - https access is now working.
   svn checkout https://gtsvn.uit.no/repos
* try to repair G5 accounts for iCal Server (**Børre**)

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

**TODO:**
* `sme->smj` lexicon conversion to build bilingual lexicon resources, and
  increase `smj` coverage (**Trond, Svenne**).
* Add the words when all words are ready.

## South Sámi

Nothing new since last week.

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

Much work last week on the SD-terms collection, and the editing code relating to
it. All old legacy code was cleaned and moved into the proper place, and
deletion of entries was added.

Next up: to finish the work on the SD-terms collection (editing), then look at
the name lexicon, and also dictionary search interface.

**TODO:**
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

MacOS X electronic dictionaries for `smenob` and `smesmj`. They work with
`Dictionary.app`, and by point-and-keypress.

Install in:
```
~/Library/Dictionaries/
```

**TODO:**

* find similar frameworks for Linux and Windows
* make simple installer applications
* make a public release
    - Make a homepage with instructions for dictionary use:
   `xtdoc/gtuit/src/documentation/content/xdocs/dict.eng.xml`
    - Clarify the difference between local and online dictionaries:
        - Plugin for Firefox and Internet Explorer (online dictionaries)
        - Integrated dictionary for Mac 10.5 (local ones), in the future also Windows
    and Linux

# Proofing tools

## Hunspell

Strategy for creating .dic and .aff files:
Because any wordform can only be split into at most three parts (because
hunspell has maximally "double suffix stripping" (ie one suffix + one suffix)),
we decided to put wordstems into the dic file, and then put the rest of the
wordform into the aff file.

We will make one suffix lexicon for each lexc lexicon

'+' implies continuation lexicon, '*' implies lack of continuation lexicon.
```
Wordstems // dersuffix // infl // pos&clitic
100000    //  100       //  100  // 10
100000    +  (100       *   100 ) +   10   = 110 010 = divide late
100000    +   100       +  (100   *   10 ) = 101 100 = divide early
```

**TODO:**
1. test latest lexicon (**Sjur**)
1. add `smj` to the soup, make sure it works roughly as good as `sme`
  (**Børre, Thomas, Per-Eric**)
    1. added to derivations, needs to be tested
1. fix the remaining conversion bugs for `sme` (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. return to `smj`, and fix whatever is left to fix (**Børre, Tomi**)
1. release a public beta at the end of April (**Børre, Sjur**)

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)
* test new and nested error markup (**Sjur**)
