# Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in `plan/strat/5year.jspwiki`.

# Infrastructure

To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
    1. test bench enhanced, but not yet complete
1. close certain parts of the svn code repository
    1. on the todo list
1. more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
1. merge gt, kt and st into one
1. set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
    1. permanent chat rooms
    1. stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
    1. iCal server / group calendars
    1. wiki
1. wiki?  on G5 (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
1. improve Forrest stability and i18n support ( the divvun crashes)
    1. **Sjur** has been working on better i18n and pdf rendering
    1. **Børre** has some ideas for getting back to serving static html files
1. reorganise the documentation:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. Apertium (http://www.apertium.org/ and
   http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/) for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. sfst? Both as replacement for xfst and for hunspell/open-source proofing tools
1. investigate the NSIS installer, potentially replacing the InstallShield
  package from Polderland
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories?
1. update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

SVN issues:
* http access not yet available (https only at the moment, but it works as
  anonymous checkout if the user is *not* specified)
* read access to the whole repo is working, BUT:
    - `gt/*/polderland` should be protected
    - `plan` should be protected
* everything will be google-able by default if the repo URL is posted
* certain users need to be on the UiT VPN to be able to commit (bug #705)

**TODO:**
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* define and document testing routines (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* add Jabber account in iChat for Lene (**Trond**)
* follow-up migration to svn:
    - close the open SVN repository at requested paths (**Ciprian**)
    - rewrite `.bashrc` aliases geared towards cvs, if needed (**Trond**)
    - prepare and discuss with external users: Jack Ruether (**Trond**)
* try to repair G5 accounts for iCal Server (**Børre**)
    - update the OS at the same time
        - the G5 needs repair (**Børre**)

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=711

## Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

**TODO:**
* `sme->smj` lexicon conversion to build bilingual lexicon resources, and
  increase `smj` coverage (**Trond**).
* Add the words when all words are ready.

## South Sámi

**Jovsset** has asked the authors whether we can get a copy of the Verbh
manuscript in electronic form: The authors are willing to hand over the
manuscript. They need to clear some questions with their publisher though. This
far I have only recieved a positive response to my request.

**TODO:**
* get the Verbh manuscript in electronic form (**Jovsset**)
* hire a linguist (**Sjur**)

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

**TODO:**
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add `nob`
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

**Ciprian** has investigated dictionary making systems, looked at content
management systems in xml format (also non-textual content). Goal: one
dictionary per language, the update-one-base principle.

Bi- and multilingual dictionaries with pointers, link from dictionary,
linking between different monolingual dictionaries. For the users, the storage
does not matter.

**TODO:**
* look at our existing dictionaries (**Ciprian**)
* sketch suggestions  (**Ciprian**)
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* clean up and generalise the make infrastructure
* make Linux and Windows local/integrated versions
* make simple installer applications
* make a public release
    - Make a homepage with instructions for dictionary use:
   `xtdoc/gtuit/src/documentation/content/xdocs/dict.eng.xml`
    - Clarify the difference between local and online dictionaries:
        - Plugin for Firefox and Internet Explorer (online dictionaries)

# Proofing tools

## Hunspell

**TODO:**
1. change license on distros to GPL2+ (**Børre**)
1. QA README and installation docs (**Trond**)
1. fix the remaining conversion bugs (**Børre, Tomi**)

## Testing

  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)
