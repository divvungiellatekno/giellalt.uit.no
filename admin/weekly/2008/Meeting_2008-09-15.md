   Sweden (**Jovsset**)

# Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in `plan/strat/5year.jspwiki`.

# Infrastructure

Please install [saxon](http://saxon.sourceforge.net/)

In .bashrc:
```
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:~/lib/saxon9.jar

alias saxonXQ="java net.sf.saxon.Query"
alias saxonXSL="java net.sf.saxon.Transform"
alias xquery="saxonXQ"
alias xslt2="saxonXSL"
alias xsl2="saxonXSL"
```

To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
    1. test bench enhanced, but not yet complete
1. close certain parts of the svn code repository
    1. on the todo list
1. more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
1. merge gt, kt and st into one
1. set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
    1. permanent chat rooms
    1. stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
    1. iCal server / group calendars
    1. wiki
1. wiki?  on G5 (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
1. improve Forrest stability and i18n support ( the divvun crashes)
    1. **Sjur** has been working on better i18n and pdf rendering
    1. **Børre** has some ideas for getting back to serving static html files
1. reorganise the documentation:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. Apertium (http://www.apertium.org/ and
   http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/) for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. sfst? Both as replacement for xfst and for hunspell/open-source proofing tools
1. investigate the NSIS installer, potentially replacing the InstallShield
  package from Polderland
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories?
1. update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

SVN issues:
* http access not yet available (https only at the moment, but it works as
  anonymous checkout if the user is *not* specified)
* read access to the whole repo is working, BUT:
    - `gt/*/polderland` should be protected
    - `plan` should be protected
* everything will be google-able by default if the repo URL is posted
* certain users need to be on the UiT VPN to be able to commit (bug #705)
* UTF-8 problem in svn commit mails: the commit log text is garbled

**TODO:**
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* define and document testing routines (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* re-setup Jabber accounts in iChat (**all, Børre**)
* follow-up migration to svn:
    - close the open SVN repository at requested paths (**Ciprian**)
    - prepare and discuss with external users: Jack Ruether (**Trond**)
* setup iCal Server (on XServe) (**Børre**)
    - working on it
* repair the G5 (**Børre**)
    - has been sent to repair
* install Saxon for XSLT2 and XQuery 1 support (**all**)
    - XServe (**Børre**)
    - victorio (**Børre, Saara**)
    - make sure all have updated CLASSPATHs in their `.bashr/.profile`

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=711

## Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

**TODO:**
* `sme->smj` lexicon conversion to build bilingual lexicon resources, and
  increase `smj` coverage (**Trond**).
* Add the words when all words are ready.

## South Sámi

**TODO:**
* get the Verbh manuscript in electronic form (**Jovsset**)
* get new linguist in action (**Sjur**)

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

**TODO:**
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add `nob`
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

September:

* content revision of smenob:
    - split in noun, propernoun, adj, verb, other
    - make better content
* fix the frontend issue (windows, linux)
    - Evaluate dictionary providers (Stardict, ...)
    - Platform?

**TODO:**
* look at our existing dictionaries (**Ciprian**)
* sketch suggestions  (**Ciprian**)
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* clean up and generalise the make infrastructure
* make Linux and Windows local/integrated versions
* make simple installer applications
* make a public release
    - Make a homepage with instructions for dictionary use:
   `xtdoc/gtuit/src/documentation/content/xdocs/dict.eng.xml`
    - Clarify the difference between local and online dictionaries:
        - Plugin for Firefox and Internet Explorer (online dictionaries)

# Proofing tools

# Other

## Forthcoming Sámi allaskuvla conference

Info on the
[conference site](http://www.samiskhs.no/index.php?c=304&kat=Giellasymposia).

Title submitted is: *Goallosteapmi ja suorggideapmi Divvun-reaidduin*

Registration:
[http://www.viaregi.no/registration/deltagerweb.aspx?kid=3440&aid=8700]

Registration deadline is September 10.

**TODO:**
* register participants, see deadline above, decision next Monday
    - done

## Text to speech

We are planning a North Sámi text to speech. Work on the text-to-transcription
(ttt) component has begun, and for the transcription-to-sound we cooperate with
U Hki. For a forthcoming october demo we have two alternative tracks:

1. Do the ttt with quasi-Finnish orthography as output, and plug it onto the
  Finnish ttt (the Sámi-as-a-Finnish-priest solution)  (pro: the web demo is
  there, so the demo is within reach; con: several phonemes are missing)
1. Do the ttt with SAMPA as output, and read in 200 sentences, and have Hki generate
  a voice based upon that (pro: probably better result, head start on the
  project; con: we risk that is not be done by
1. Do both in parallel. (pro: safety first, not much double work; con: well,
  the double work in the phon-sme.xfst file)

The best thing would probably be to do both tracks, to be on the safe side.

**TODO:**
* (Meeting to) improve the rule set (**Trond, Patrik, Biret Ánne**)
    - done
* Technical issues on the ttt automata (**Trond, ...**)
* Moving input to required xml format (**Helsinki**)
* Read in the 200 sentences (**Biret Ánne**)
* Make sounds out of them (**Helsinki**)

## Corpus contracts + open source

Postponed until the svn repository is fully functional (it is too open now).
