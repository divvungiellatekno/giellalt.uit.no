# Corpus gathering

A large amount of new corpus files from SD and the government has been added by
**Børre** and his atom-reader script. It is all bilingual.

**Trond** has added two files to
`orig/nob/facta/depts/ NOU200120010035000DDDPDFA.pdf`,
`NOU199419940021000DDDPDFA.pdf`, they are linked from the relevant files in
`sme/facta/depts/` (the files are  `NAC_2001_35.pdf.xsl` and
`NAC_1994_21.pdf.xsl`), but the nob files have no .xsl files themselves.

**TODO:**
* get the 2006-2010 Sámi Parliament protocolls into our repository (**Børre**)
    - found them, needs to be processed and published
* contact the Sámi translators at the government and ministeries to get more
  parallell texts (**Børre**)
* continue gathering `sma` corpus texts (**Maja**)
    - get `sma` articles in Š-bláđđi
    - the Gun Utsi book is almost there - one contract missing (**Maja**)
* send a copy of the signed contracts back to the authors, translators and
  publishers, accompanied by the thank-you letter
* find and contact the correct person in SD, to get the manuscript for all Sámi
  teaching material now being given out to the schools (**Børre**)
* get the `sma` yearbooks from *Saemien sïjhte* (**Maja**)
* contact Inga Margrethe Bjørn Eira (**Maja**)
* give Maja a WebSak intro (**Børre**)
* restart the letter mailing thing using WebSak (**Maja**)

# Promoting Divvun

**TODO:**
* make leaflet to inform about the project (**Børre**)
    - add InDesign text (**Sjur**)
    - make XSL script to transform Forrest XDocs to an OOo Drawer document
   (**Børre, Sjur**)
* distribute CD version through the library bus, the language centres and
  common sami centres in all of Sápmi. Gaaltije in Östersund for example.
  (**Leif Åge, Sjur**)
    - make him send out CD's accordingly (**Sjur**)
* update online download log statistics page (**Børre**)
* make an info campaign about our language technology products and services
  (financed by the Sámi Parliament) - send out people that travel around and
  demonstrate and inform about our tools etc.

# Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in `plan/strat/5year.jspwiki`.

## Northern areas project

We got financing for the kick-off / intro seminar, 218 000 NOK. We will arrange
the seminar in February probably. The keyboard project was not funded, needs to
be part of the real project instead.

**TODO:**
* Course plan for meeting/seminar, february. Financing is in place.
* Attend a beginners' course in Russian (priority: the alphabet!) near you..
* make a plan for the first two years, update overall plan (**Trond, Sjur**)
* Follow up machines for the seminar

# Infrastructure

Out of the box experiences:
* fao could not be compiled out of the box (the Oslo gang tried) because of a
  missing `tmp` dir
    - is easily resolved by a `mkdir -p` command in the make files
* our list of software to install is incomplete or lacking installation
  instructions
* external tools require manual installation
* there are bugs in the gtsetup.sh script

## Updated corpus online

See **Ciprian´s** document about the corpus content in
`$GTPRIV/plan/corpus/oslo_corpus_update_todo.txt`.

Issues:
* filenames
* organisation of subdirs?
* content (or lack thereof) of original and converted files
* svn repo reorganisation

```
facta$convert2xml.pl --nolog --corpdir=/usr/local/share/corp L1allOrt.correct.txt
```

Error message:
```
sh: /home/sjur/gtmain/gt/script/text_cat: No such file or directory
L1allOrt.correct.txt: ERROR errors in /home/sjur/gtmain/gt/script/text_cat -q \
   -x -d /home/sjur/gtmain/gt/script/LM "/usr/local/share/corp/tmp/L1allOrt.correct.txt.tmp0":
```

`text_cat` isn't part of our repository, we need to add it - we are using a
modified version of the original file. It should be added with a short README
and some license info, pointing to the original.

**TODO:**
* analyse/disambiguate (**Ciprian**)
* preferably also dep -> check with Oslo if it can be used (**Ciprian**)
* install in Oslo (**Ciprian, Trond**)
* add better handling of unknown strings in our analysers (**???**)

## Corpus infra remake

**TODO:**
* reorganise subdirs as needed (**Ciprian, Trond**)
* identify parallel nob files - should be automatic, but needs to be checked
  (**Ciprian**)
    - almost done: an exhaustive check of the parallelity based on the existing
   non-Saami files is required (**Ciprian**)
* sentence-align `sme` with `nob` and `nob` with `sme` (**Ciprian**)
    - done: we should perhaps update our anchor file for the tca2 tool.
* fix the upload script after the corpus infra remake (**Børre**)
* turn on corpus summary crontab (**Børre**)
* needs to check the conversion from old rcs corpus repository to new svn-based
  repository (**Ciprian**)
* develop test routines for the analyse/disambiguate/dep procedure

## Corpus interface

This depends on the infrastructure cleanup.

**TODO:**
* make a simple web search form for the UiT corpus repository (**Ciprian**)
* check out the new version of CWB with Unicode support (**Ciprian**)
    - fall

## Makefile + tag simplification

In the lexc files do: `+Err/Sub:W5`, in twolc: use `W5:0` as anchor for the
sloppy rules (Tomi rules). Please rename the rules to something more
descriptive.

**TODO:**
* convert M4 twolc processing to transducer manipulation (**Tomi, Sjur**)
    - done, but needs some cleanup
    - then do hyphenation
* errors in ped fst compilation - move the new code to a separate branch for
  easier cooperation in bug-hunting and fixing; announce when ready (**Tomi**)
    - done
* testing (only `sme`):
    - make new fst's (**Tomi**)
    - make old fst's (**Thomas**)
    - analyse text with old and new, descr. and norm - compare results
   (**Thomas, Lene, Trond**)

## HFST compilation

Our HFST transducers do still contain all the extra tags resulting from the tag
conversion (cf above). The Apertium versions do not, however. The main problem
here is the forking of smi transducer builing and maintenance - one branch in
Giellatekno, and another in Apertium. This is not good for future maintenance,
and should be corrected ASAP. The tag-removing make steps should be
incorporated in the giellatekno svn.

Status:
* compiled on Linux once, then not at later points
* they are using a glibc error handling not available on the Mac
* all backends are plugable libraries, needs to be installed separately:
    - OpenFST
        - doesn't compile either for **Sjur**
    - Foma
    - SFST?

**TODO:**
* try to compile again hfst and all dependencies, Mac and Linux (**Børre**)
* if no success, arrange a meeting with the hfst group (**Sjur**)

## General list

To accommodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
    1. test bench enhanced, but not yet complete
1. improve Forrest i18n support with static sites
1. reorganise the documentation:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in Forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium](http://www.apertium.org/) and
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
1. update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

**TODO:**
* forrest makeover: (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - upgrade the forrest installation on everybody's computers (head of svn trunk
   of forrest) (**Børre, Sjur, all**)
    - check that pdf and text versions of readme files are available
    - make sure Unicode in Forrest pdf is working (no ? for "eng"/ŋ)
    - implement language switch for static divvun site
* make the new SL Server services functional: (**Børre**)
    - group calendars
* finish the restructuring  and cleaning of the `script/` directory
  **Ciprian**)
* infrastructure remake: (**Børre, Ciprian, Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)
    - more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
        - look at omorfi for ideas of how to modularise
    - merge gt, kt and st into one
    - modularised preprocess and spellrelax
    - alternatives to make:
        - [SCons](http://www.scons.org/)
        - [makepp](http://makepp.sourceforge.net/)
        - [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (for java-projects)
        - [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) - **Sjur** looked at it, and have started to
    experiment
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* define and document testing routines (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

There are a lot of hyphens found in noun paradigms. They should not be there.
Trond and Thomas will look into them.

**TODO:**
* check extra hyphens in the sme lexc continuations (**Thomas, Trond**)

## Lule Sámi

**TODO:**
* check extra hyphens in the smj lexc continuations (**Thomas, Trond**)

## South Sámi

**TODO:**
* go through the lexicon and add for all loan words a form corresponding to the
  suggestion from Ove Lorentz (other forms should be SUB-marked)
  (**Maja, Thomas**)
* adjectives (**Maja** with **Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
    - two competing naming conventions of continuation lexicons
        - One naming goes ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE
        - One follows the `sme` convention of naming key adjectives
        - There are duplicate lexica
    - The comparative issue open here and there
        - The ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE lexica now go to EVENCOMP and
    ODDCOMP only.
* finish compound tags for adjectives (**Maja**)

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

Most of the items that used to be listed here are now moved to the new risten2
project, scheduled for next year.

**TODO:**
* refine the requirements for risten.no 2.0 (**Ciprian, Sjur, TermTeam, SD**)
* another meeting Tuesday 28. at 12:00 on the phone/net (Google Docs)

# Dictionaries

## Net-/browser-based interface

**Ciprian** is compiling a new set of dictionaries.

**TODO:**
* set up risten.no on eXist/XServe (as a beta version site) (**Sjur**)
* set up required infra for smenob on risten.no/XServe (**Sjur**)

## Mobile
WeDict dictionary client for iOS (uses stardict dictionary files):
[http://app.weiphone.com/wedict/]

iPod/iPhone has (almost) no problem with Unicode text input (but users HAVE to
know how to use unicode as input).
There are two letters missing, **ŧ, ŋ**, the other ones are there.
You may use Serbo-Croat, or QUERTY, when writing North Sami on iPod.

There is one possible issue:
[http://code.google.com/p/wedictpro/issues/detail?id=2]

**TODO:**
* developing the mobile phone version of smenob/our content (**Ciprian**)
    - [http://pfed.info/wksite/]

## Desktop

StarDict is useless for Cyrillic languages, mainly because of the scanning
function (ie point and look-up). We need to find an alternative to StarDict.
Also, the Kildin Sámi users have different needs than we have had in mind. And
they don't have access to a Kildin Sámi keyboard in Windows.

* we need a Russian Windows machine, bought in Russia, using the software they
  use
* we also of course need a western/Norwegian Windows machine for testing

Released:
* SME:NOB update release

## Content

**TODO:**
* kom:fin-eng
    - moved the original kom-lex.xml to the inc-dir and froze it
    - split it by pos into the working_file dir, the ONLY place to work with
   the dictionary entries
    - now, the lexC files are generated via XSLT sheets, no perl scripts
    - adjusted the Makefile
    - prepared the pipeline for compiling the mac dict
    - todo: make a pipeline for StarDict also (as far as I know, **Jaska** has)
   a Linux machine
* Komi
    - take out the doublets to a separate file (**Ciprian**)
    - merge the doublets (**Jaska, Trond**)
    - Completing the automaton to some state (**Trond, Jaska, Paula**)

## General

Other things dictionary-related:
* risten.no data as part of our dictionaries
* dictionaries as part of risten.no
* dictionaries and risten.no as part of Autshumato ITE

**TODO:**
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* end user documentation (how to download and install) (**Ciprian, Trond**)
* correct the sort XSL script wrt the whitespace issue, stylesheet/doctype ref
  (**Ciprian**)

# Proofing tools

Spelling feedback from Malta:
* use FST to model suggestions (Krister et al)
* Lene is evaluating the output of the Polderland speller
    - first-letter errors rare, but the PLX speller still changes it quite often
    - Oahpa and Divvun approaching each other
* using Wikipedia as a source for spelling errors and test material (a French
  group has made a setup of tools to automatise most of this)

## South Sámi

The `sma` speller is not compiling allright, and hasn't been for the last
couple of weeks. Diagnosis is still open, but pointing to regex filters.

**TODO:**
* test conversion to xml to ensure there are no markup errors
  (**Maja, Sjur, Thomas**)
* difftest for fst and PL speller (**Sjur**)
* write readme file (**Sjur, Thomas, Tomi**)
* fix sma speller issues (**Tomi**)

## HFST- and Voikko-based proofing tools

**TODO:**
* run tests using Hunspell, Voikko, Polderland for our Sámi lexicons
  (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* check out the voikko code, see [this page
| https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/voikko/wiki/libvoikko/IntegrationTesting]
  or [this page](http://voikko.sourceforge.net/source-mac.html)
  (**Tomi**)
* try to compile Voikko (development is done on Linux, no MacOS X testing so
  far) (**Tomi**)
* add voikko support to our proofing test bench (**Sjur**)
* add all our Sámi analysers and test them as spellers (**Tomi, Sjur**)

## Speller bugs

List of bugs returned from Polderland:

# Nordplus Språk proofing test bench project

Arno Teigseth is hired for the summer. He is sitting in Equador, 7 hours after
Norway. He is working with a quechua speller (using hunspell) and dictionary.

A goal is to use texts from parallel domains, in order to be
able to compare nob and sme. We start out with 100000 words, 5000
for each genre:
1. Discussion fora on the net
1. Blogs

Discussion fora can be problematic, as they contain a lot of very oral language
with deliberate oral or dialectal forms used in the text. As such, the texts
won't be typical for the kind of texts people would like to spell-check, and
thus the genre is problematic for the purpose at hand.

Possible other genres:
1. Minutes from local associations
1. Pupil texts - look for the home pages of the schools
1. exam texts by 10th grade pupils, where the pupils have published the texts
  themselves
1. skrivebua - Nordland fylkeskommune: all three Sámi languages

# Text to speech

There will be regular meetings in this project from now on, every second week.

**TODO:**
* put together the preprocessing transducers and scripts (**Tomi**)
* refine syntax / dependency rules (**Biret Ánne**)
* continue public tender process (**Sjur**)

# Machine Translation

Francis wants to release the sme-nob MT, but the release requires testing
first. There is an established testing procedure.

**TODO**
* Discuss testbench setup with Francis (**Trond**)

## All languages

**TODO:**
* Improve the sme-dis for MT purposes
* Go through the bilingual transfer lexica for more general translations
* Add alternative translations and selection rules
* Arrange an Apertium seminar (later)
* transfer hfst build infra from Apertium to Giellatekno

## finsme

Technical problems with compounds in Finnish: each part in the compound is
separated by a space character (+Ux20), which is creating problems in the
transfer.

**TODO**
* Tag unification
* Adp split in fin (**Trond**)

## smenob

Needed: Lexicon completion. Grammatical transfer rules

## smesmj

New worker underway.

## smesma

Infrastructure in place, to demo in Trondheim to encourage more work and
projects.

# CAT

**Ciprian** has updated the translation memory based on our parallel corpus.
It is based on 923 parallel files. It needs to be tested, but it looks
promising.

**TODO:**
* make intelligent nobsme risten.no - requires `nob` morphology
    - nob.fst a la Trond
    - norskordbank.fst
    - nob.fst based on an xml source synchronised with Ordbanken source texts
    - should be coordinated with the Apertium analyser
* write a TM script to turn a parallell corpus into TM entries (**Ciprian**)
    - deadline: next Monday, 20.9.
* test TMX files, if ok, forward link to SD (**Ciprian, Sjur**)
* testing A-ITE on Norwegian Windows
    - done by our friends in RSA - bug identified, workaround sent by e-mail

# SMA seminar in August/September followup

**TODO:**
* update the XXE configuration to include the oahpa additions
  (**Ciprian, Sjur**)
    - done but not yet announced, needs user documentation first
* write user documentation (**Sjur**)

# Other

## Start to make yearly reports

Directory in svn in place, now we only need to fill it with content...
