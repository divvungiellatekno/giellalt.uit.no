# Infrastructure

## Updated corpus online

Trond would need an alignment of all parallel text (sme-nob) as well as a
reanalysis of the whole sme corpus, to put on the Oslo corpus server, by May
6th.

**TODO:**
1. convert to xml, should be done already (**Ciprian**)
1. identify parallel nob files - should be automatic, but needs to be checked
  (**Ciprian**)
1. sentence-align sme with nob (**Ciprian**)
1. analyse/disambiguate (**Ciprian**)
1. preferably also dep -> check with Oslo if it can be used (**Ciprian**)
1. install in Oslo (**Ciprian, Trond**)

## Corpus infra remake

* only access from victorio + XServe (**Børre**)
    - done
* write access only for corpus maintainers (**Børre**)
    - done
* read access for the rest of our teams + outsiders who have signed the corpus
  usage agreement (**Børre**)
    - not yet - only bound group can read (and write). This is too narrow, we need
   a different group for read-only access (still only on victorio)
* convert or move the files in the `upload` dir to the real corpus repo
  (**Børre**)
    - not done - they lack meta info
* turn on corpus summary crontab (**Børre**)

    - before May
* check out the new version of CWB with Unicode support (**Ciprian**)
    - fall

## Makefile + tag simplification

**TODO:**
1. convert lexc files - all in `gt/` dir tree && update existing make targets
  to work with the converted lexc files:
    1. convert lexc files for testing old make targets (**Tomi**)
    1. update makefile (old targets) (**Tomi**)
    1. announce imminent converstion - Tuesday afternoon (**Tomi**)
    1. everybody check in *all* local lexc changes in the `gt/` tree - Wednesday
   (**all**)
    1. actual lexc conversion - Thursday (**Tomi**)
    1. announce conversion done (and new conventions) (**Tomi**)
    1. svn up, and continue lexc work using new lexc tags (**all**)
        1. all done

    1. next up, high priority
1. when the new build infrastructure works as it should, delete the old ones
   (**Sjur, Tomi**)

## General list

Now that we have the FIN-CG from Fred Karlsson, we also need a way of
integrating Omorfi in a proper way with our svn repository. External references
could be one alternative. We have to find a way of doing this consistently,
there might be other code repositories we want to integrate with as well (e.g.
Apertium).

Meänkieli adaptions in our infrastructure.

Requirements:
* separate Subversion repository
* structured roughly as our main repository
* limited access to the closed repo, in the sense that one language group should
  not be able to see the work of another language group (exception for
  administrators) - otherwise it isn't really secret/closed. That is, the FIT
  gang should only see FIT files, and a hypothetical e.g. Estonian gang should
  only see the Estonian files, not the FIT files, etc. But to the extent that
  there are (links to) shared resources the (e.g. links to infrastructure things
  in another place), they should be visible to all groups
* all tools, dtd's, configs work as in and from the main Subversion, such that
  we don't end up with multiple copies. That is, only content files and no
  infrastructure files should be in the closed repo - all the rest should stay
  in the main repo
* we should have scripts that move a full language dir from one repo to the
  other, in both directions, keeping svn history etc.
* the amount of work for setting this up should be minimal, or we have to ask
  them for money

Tentative task list
* figure out the svn dir structure in the closed lang repo, set it up
* figure out how to make the infrastructure in the open/main repo available for
  work in the closed repo (we want to have only one dtd, one XXE config, one
  makefile, etc.)
* when we have an idea of the amount of work, decide whether we just do it, or
  whether we bill them
* implement the previous point
* transfer the language files, preferably using a script for automatic transfer
  and deletion in the open repo
* inform them about the changes

To accommodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
    1. test bench enhanced, but not yet complete
1. improve Forrest i18n support with static sites
1. reorganise the documentation:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in Forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium](http://www.apertium.org/) and 
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
1. update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

**TODO:**
* make the new SL Server services functional: (**Børre**)
    - group calendars
* set up corpus mirroring on the XServe again (**Børre**)
* finish the restructuring  and cleaning of the `script/` directory
  **Ciprian**)
    - has been working a lot on this, at least in number of commits:)
* infrastructure remake: (**Børre, Ciprian, Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)
    - more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
        - look at omorfi for ideas of how to modularise
    - merge gt, kt and st into one
    - modularised preprocess and spellrelax
    - alternatives to make:
        - [SCons](http://www.scons.org/)
        - [makepp](http://makepp.sourceforge.net/)
        - [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (for java-projects)
        - [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) - **Sjur** looked at it, and have started to
    experiment
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* define and document testing routines (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* meeting to discuss the FIT request for closed repository tomorrow at 9.30
  (**Børre, Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - techdoc/infra/system/svndump-notes.txt
        - done - but no working solution yet

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## South Sámi

**TODO:**
* Prepare texts about normativity issue to SGL/SGM (**Maja**)
    - look at Trond's XXX comments (**Maja**)
    - read through and comment by Wednesday afternoon (**Sjur**)
* adjectives (**Maja** with **Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
    - two competing naming conventions of continuation lexicons
        - One naming goes ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE
        - One follows the `sme` convention of naming key adjectives
        - There are duplicate lexica
    - The comparative issue open here and there
        - The ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE lexica now go to EVENCOMP and
    ODDCOMP only.
* finish compound tags for adjectives (**Maja**)

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

**TODO:**
* find already approved lists, in paper or electronic form (**term team**)
* convert paper lists to electronic lists (**term team**)
* convert lists to standard XML (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add prepared lists to risten.no (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
* fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
* finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
* test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
* make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add `nob`
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
* convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
* implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
  the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
  to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
  official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
* start to use the xml file as source file
* clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, linguists**)
* merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
* publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
* add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
* add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

Nothing new.

Comming releases:
* FKV dictionary release: we need a web page (see task list below).
* SME:NOB update release

Other things dictionary-related:
* risten.no data as part of our dictionaries
* dictionaries as part of risten.no
* dictionaries and risten.no as part of Autshumato ITE

**TODO:**

    - content and webpage update (**Trond, Verena**)
    - compile the MacDict and StarDict versions (**Ciprian**)
* kom:fin-eng
    - moved the original kom-lex.xml to the inc-dir and froze it
    - split it by pos into the working_file dir, the ONLY place to work with
   the dictionary entries
    - now, the lexC files are generated via XSLT sheets, no perl scripts
    - adjusted the Makefile
    - prepared the pipeline for compiling the mac dict
    - todo: make a pipeline for StarDict also (as far as I know, **Jaska** has)
   a Linux machine
* set up risten.no on eXist/XServe (as a beta version site) (**Sjur**)
* set up required infra for smenob on risten.no/XServe (**Sjur**)
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* end user documentation (how to download and install) (**Ciprian, Trond**)
* Contact *Davvi Girji* about cooperation on electronic dictionaries
  (**Sjur**)

  sorted

# Proofing tools

## South Sámi

Beta release: June 1. We should be getting the Polderland (now Knowledge
Concepts - hereafter KC) binaries in the second half of May.

Update: no updated contract proposal yet from KC despite promises. The lack of
response from them is concerning, and poses a risk for the project and its 
abilities for reaching the planed goals. We need to start planning for an 
alternative proofing solution, based on Voikko.

**Sjur** has been in talks with **Krister Lindén** about whether the HFST team 
can speed up the development of the HFST code, and the speller and 
hyphenator parts of it. He will continue the talks.

**TODO:**
* difftest for fst and PL speller (**Sjur**)
* External beta testers:
    - David
    - Jovsset
    - the Røros group
* gold standard testing (**Sjur**)

## HFST- and Voikko-based proofing tools

We need to test the Sámi analysers with the latest LibVoikko, and give 
feedback to Harry Pitkänen (the lead Voikko developer) within this week.

**TODO:**
* check out the voikko code, see [this page
| https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/voikko/wiki/libvoikko/IntegrationTesting]
  (**Tomi**)
* try to compile it (development is done on Linux, no MacOS X testing so far)
  (**Tomi, Sjur**)
* add voikko support to our proofing test bench (**Sjur**)
* add all our Sámi analysers and test them as spellers (**Tomi, Sjur**)

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* test new and nested error markup (**Sjur**)
    - nesting still needs to be tested, depends on new `ccat` feature

### Speller testing

**TODO:**
* test the error type selection feature in ccat (**Sjur**)

### Testing open-source Norwegian spellers

**Sjur** has invited the open-source group to test their spell-checker using our
test bench. The response has been positive, we'll see what happens.

We should go to their developer meetings, and present our work and how to work
with language technology.

## Speller bugs

List of bugs returned from Polderland:
* 621
* 630
* 652
* 656
* 676

Tag reordering for abbreviations have caused a lot of problems:

```
smj:
hr.
hr.	hr+ABBR+Acc
cand.philol.
cand.philol.	cand.philol+ABBR+N+Acc
Per
Per	Per+N+Prop+Mal+Sg+Attr

sme:
hr.
hr.	hr+N+ABBR+Acc
Per
Per	Per+N+Prop+Mal+Sg+Attr
```

## CAT

Autshuhamo-ITE is now available, and we want to set up a proof-of-concept server
to demonstrate how we (soon) can provide a translator's workbench with
integrated machine translation (and also dictionary and terminology content).

Apertium installed at:
```
/opt/MT/
/opt/MT/apertium3.0.4
```

Apertium is working in victorio, with one dirty fix: I had to make the following
link:
* local/bin/cg-proc -> /usr/local/bin/cg-proc

```
apertium-nn-nb$echo ikke |apertium -d . nb-nn
ikkje
```

**TODO:**
* test Apertium integration with A-ITE (**Ciprian, Sjur**)
* convert our dictionaries to A-ITE format, so that they can be used directly in
  there

## Norsk språkbank
Sámi will form a  part of Norsk språkbank. We should consider candidates
for pilot content (preferably terminology or bilingual text) for a first
presentation of Språkbanken.
