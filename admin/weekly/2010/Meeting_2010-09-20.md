    - restart the letter mailing thing using WebSak
        - Don't know what this is; you should send out letters to the authors and publishers that the contract is now registered, and under which archive number in the Sámi Parliament. This has not been properly done for all contracts in the past, but Børre started to do this earlier. Thus, he is the one to give you an introduction.OK!

# Corpus gathering

National Library: there is a meeting September 23, to which Trond and Sjur are
going. Trond will request a couple of Sámi OCR-ed texts (together with the
`nob` texts we already have), and use them as test cases for spell-checking
and (automatically) correcting the OCR-ed texts.

What we need now is free North Sami - Norwegian parallel text, because of 
Autshumato.

**TODO:**
* get the 2006-2010 Sámi Parliament protocolls into our repository (**Børre**)
* contact the Sámi translators at the government and ministeries to get more
  parallell texts (**Børre**)
* continue gathering `sma` corpus texts (**Maja**)
    - get `sma` articles in Š-bláđđi
    - the Gun Utsi book is almost there - one contract missing (**Maja**)
* send a copy of the signed contracts back to the authors, translators and 
  publishers, accompanied by the thank-you letter

* update online download log statistics page (**Børre**)
* make an info campaign about our language technology products and services
  (financed by the Sámi Parliament) - send out people that travel around and
  demonstrate and inform about our tools etc.

# Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in `plan/strat/5year.jspwiki`.

## Northern areas project

First major obstacle: make working keyboards and fonts.
In principle, there are two approaches to keyboards:

1. Make the Russian-based keyboards work
1. Design new Kildin-optimized keyboards

The first goal has priority. We should have text analysis in order to consider
whether the second goal is feasible. Trond to follow up test machines.

* Choice of fonts
* Rendering of fonts in MS Word and other important programs
* Keyboard layout
    - Empirical phase: What keyboards are around
    - Design phase: Make the optimal keyboards -- for all OSes

Write trustworthy and detailed documentation (in Russian)

What we know:
* you can type on some computers (Michael R: it works), not on others. Q: what
  are the differences between the two types of computers?
* some fonts can't display the chars, others can (but usually ugly)

**TODO:**
* Course plan for meeting/seminar, october. Financing must be in place.
    - check the time needed to tet visas with the UiT admin (**Trond**)
    - call the ministry (**Trond**)
* Attend a beginners' course in Russian (priority: the alphabet!) near you..
* make a plan for the first two years, update overall plan (**Trond, Sjur**)
* Follow up Windows test machines

# Infrastructure

Out of the box experiences:
* fao could not be compiled out of the box (the Oslo gang tried) because of a
  missing `tmp` dir
    - is easily resolved by a `mkdir -p` command in the make files
* our list of software to install is incomplete or lacking installation
  instructions
* external tools require manual installation
* there are bugs in the gtsetup.sh script

## Updated corpus online

See **Ciprian´s** document about the corpus content in
`$GTPRIV/plan/corpus/oslo_corpus_update_todo.txt`.

Issues:
* filenames
* organisation of subdirs?
* content (or lack thereof) of original and converted files
* svn repo reorganisation

```
facta$convert2xml.pl --nolog --corpdir=/usr/local/share/corp L1allOrt.correct.txt
```

Error message:
```
sh: /home/sjur/gtmain/gt/script/text_cat: No such file or directory
L1allOrt.correct.txt: ERROR errors in /home/sjur/gtmain/gt/script/text_cat -q \
   -x -d /home/sjur/gtmain/gt/script/LM "/usr/local/share/corp/tmp/L1allOrt.correct.txt.tmp0": 
```

`text_cat` isn't part of our repository, we need to add it - we are using a
modified version of the original file. It should be added with a short README
and some license info, pointing to the original.

**TODO:**
* make the conversion scripts work with the new svn repository
  (**Børre, Ciprian**)
    - add check for almost empty content
        - already implemented in convert2xml.pl. Still empty or almost empty files
    are converted. This is because of unexpected structure of content, so that
    the conversion goes wrong, and leaves no real content in the resulting xml
    file.
    - add processing of svg files
        - not done
* reorganise subdirs as needed (**Ciprian, Trond**)
    - not yet done
* identify parallel nob files - should be automatic, but needs to be checked
  (**Ciprian**)
* sentence-align sme with nob (**Ciprian**)
    - the aligner wasn't working, **Børre** has tried to fix it
        - not yet fixed - bug not found
* analyse/disambiguate (**Ciprian**)
* preferably also dep -> check with Oslo if it can be used (**Ciprian**)
* install in Oslo (**Ciprian, Trond**)
* add better handling of unknown strings in our analysers (**???**)

## Corpus infra remake

**TODO:**
* meeting to go through open issues and divide workload Tuesday 10.00
  (**Børre, Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* fix the upload script after the corpus infra remake (**Børre**)
* turn on corpus summary crontab (**Børre**)
* needs to check the conversion from old rcs corpus repository to new svn-based
  repository (**Ciprian**)

## Corpus interface

This depends on the infrastructure cleanup.

**TODO:**
* make a simple web search form for the UiT corpus repository (**Ciprian**)
* check out the new version of CWB with Unicode support (**Ciprian**)
    - fall

## Makefile + tag simplification

First part done. All linguists need to test the new transducer, to see  that 
we get what we want. Most important: that the descriptive / normative border 
is as it used to be. **Tomi** has been testing norm/desc fst's with xfst 
minus operator. Now we also need to compare actual output from the two fst's 
with before and after versions.

**TODO:**
* convert M4 twolc processing to transducer manipulation (**Tomi, Sjur**)
    - first do norm/desc merging
        - done - needs (more) testing
    - then do hyphenation
* testing (only `sme`):
    - make new fst's (**Tomi**)
    - make old fst's (**Thomas**)
    - analyse text with old and new, descr. and norm - compare results
   (**Thomas, Lene, Trond**)

## HFST compilation

Our HFST transducers do still contain all the extra tags resulting from the tag
conversion (cf above). The Apertium versions do not, however. The main problem
here is the forking of smi transducer builing and maintenance - one branch in 
Giellatekno, and another in Apertium. This is not good for future maintenance,
and should be corrected ASAP. The tag-removing make steps should be
incorporated in the giellatekno svn.

## General list

To accommodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
    1. test bench enhanced, but not yet complete
1. improve Forrest i18n support with static sites
1. reorganise the documentation:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in Forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium](http://www.apertium.org/) and 
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
1. update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

**TODO:**
* forrest makeover: (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - make the site build again
    - upgrade all forrest installations, so we are all using the same baseline
    - make the readme files for the proofing tools functional again
    - implement language switch for static divvun site
* make the new SL Server services functional: (**Børre**)
    - group calendars
* finish the restructuring  and cleaning of the `script/` directory
  **Ciprian**)
* infrastructure remake: (**Børre, Ciprian, Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)
    - more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
        - look at omorfi for ideas of how to modularise
    - merge gt, kt and st into one
    - modularised preprocess and spellrelax
    - alternatives to make:
        - [SCons](http://www.scons.org/)
        - [makepp](http://makepp.sourceforge.net/)
        - [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (for java-projects)
        - [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) - **Sjur** looked at it, and have started to
    experiment
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* define and document testing routines (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

There are a lot of hyphens found in noun paradigms. They should not be there.
Trond and Thomas will look into them.

**TODO:**
* check extra hyphens in the sme lexc continuations (**Thomas, Trond**)

## Lule Sámi

**TODO:**
* check extra hyphens in the smj lexc continuations (**Thomas, Trond**)

## South Sámi

We shall first convert the loanwords in the existing lexicon, before
considering adding more loanwords.

**TODO:**
* go through the lexicon and add for all loan words a form corresponding to the
  suggestion from Ove Lorentz (other forms should be SUB-marked)
  (**Maja, Thomas**)
* adjectives (**Maja** with **Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
    - two competing naming conventions of continuation lexicons
        - One naming goes ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE
        - One follows the `sme` convention of naming key adjectives
        - There are duplicate lexica
    - The comparative issue open here and there
        - The ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE lexica now go to EVENCOMP and
    ODDCOMP only.
* finish compound tags for adjectives (**Maja**)

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

Most of the items that used to be listed here are now moved to the new risten2
project, scheduled for next year.

**TODO:**
* refine the requirements for risten.no 2.0 (**Ciprian, Sjur, TermTeam, SD**)

# Dictionaries

**Ciprian** has made a new online/offline dictionary interface based on
Apertium tools. See [http://gtsvn.uit.no/webdict/gtd_lookup.html].

WeDict dictionary client for iOS (uses stardict dictionary files):
[http://app.weiphone.com/wedict/]

iPod/iPhone has (almost) no problem with Unicode text input (but users HAVE to know how to use unicode as input)
There are two letters missing, **ŧ, ŋ**, the other ones are there.
You may use Serbo-Croat, or QUERTY, when writing North Sami on iPod.

There is one possible issue:
[http://code.google.com/p/wedictpro/issues/detail?id=2]

StarDict is useless for Cyrillic languages, mainly because of the scanning
function (ie point and look-up). We need to find an alternative to StarDict.
Also, the Kildin Sámi users have different needs than we have had in mind. And
they don't have access to a Kildin Sámi keyboard in Windows.

* we need a Russian Windows machine, bought in Russia, using the software they
  use
* we also of course need a western/Norwegian Windows machine for testing

Released:
* SME:NOB update release

Other things dictionary-related:
* risten.no data as part of our dictionaries
* dictionaries as part of risten.no
* dictionaries and risten.no as part of Autshumato ITE

**TODO:**
* kom:fin-eng
    - moved the original kom-lex.xml to the inc-dir and froze it
    - split it by pos into the working_file dir, the ONLY place to work with
   the dictionary entries
    - now, the lexC files are generated via XSLT sheets, no perl scripts
    - adjusted the Makefile
    - prepared the pipeline for compiling the mac dict
    - todo: make a pipeline for StarDict also (as far as I know, **Jaska** has)
   a Linux machine
* set up risten.no on eXist/XServe (as a beta version site) (**Sjur**)
* set up required infra for smenob on risten.no/XServe (**Sjur**)
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* end user documentation (how to download and install) (**Ciprian, Trond**)
* Contact *Davvi Girji* about cooperation on electronic dictionaries
  (**Sjur**)
* developing the mobile phone version of smenob:
    - [http://pfed.info/wksite/]
* Komi
    - take out the doublets to a separate file (**Ciprian**)
    - merge the doublets (**Jaska, Trond**)
    - Completing the automaton to some state (**Trond, Jaska, Paula**)
* make the sort XSL script available for all languages to keep the source files
  sorted

# Proofing tools

Spelling feedback from Malta:
* use FST to model suggestions (Krister et al)
* Lene is evaluating the output of the Polderland speller
    - first-letter errors rare, but the PLX speller still changes it quite often
    - Oahpa and Divvun approaching each other
* using Wikipedia as a source for spelling errors and test material (a French
  group has made a setup of tools to automatise most of this)

## South Sámi

**TODO:**
* test conversion to xml to ensure there are no markup errors
  (**Maja, Sjur, Thomas**)
* difftest for fst and PL speller (**Sjur**)
* write readme file (**Sjur, Thomas, Tomi**)
* new beta version on Friday, September 17; check-in deadline on Thur (**Tomi**)

## HFST- and Voikko-based proofing tools

**TODO:**
* run tests using Hunspell, Voikko, Polderland for our Sámi lexicons
  (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* check out the voikko code, see [this page
| https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/voikko/wiki/libvoikko/IntegrationTesting]
  or [this page](http://voikko.sourceforge.net/source-mac.html)
  (**Tomi**)
* try to compile Voikko (development is done on Linux, no MacOS X testing so
  far) (**Tomi**)
* add voikko support to our proofing test bench (**Sjur**)
* add all our Sámi analysers and test them as spellers (**Tomi, Sjur**)

## Speller bugs

List of bugs returned from Polderland:
* 621
* 630
* 652
* 656
* 676

Tag reordering for abbreviations have caused a lot of problems:

# Nordplus Språk proofing test bench project

Arno Teigseth is hired for the summer. He is sitting in Equador, 7 hours after
Norway. He is working with a quechua speller (using hunspell) and dictionary.

A goal is to use texts from parallel domains, in order to be
able to compare nob and sme. We start out with 100000 words, 5000
for each genre:
1. Discussion fora on the net
1. Blogs

Discussion fora can be problematic, as they contain a lot of very oral language
with deliberate oral or dialectal forms used in the text. As such, the texts
won't be typical for the kind of texts people would like to spell-check, and
thus the genre is problematic for the purpose at hand.

Possible other genres:
1. Minutes from local associations
1. Pupil texts - look for the home pages of the schools
1. exam texts by 10th grade pupils, where the pupils have published the texts
  themselves
1. skrivebua - Nordland fylkeskommune: all three Sámi languages

# Text to speech

There will be regular meetings in this project from now on, every second week.

**TODO:**
* put together the preprocessing transducers and scripts (**Tomi**)
* refine syntax / dependency rules (**Biret Ánne**)
* continue public tender process (**Sjur**)

# Machine Translation

Background:

Kevin and Ryan have now closed the work on smenob and finsme. They will
continue, but mainly do other things. As for smesmj, the possible student
input is rescheduled for October.

We hope to have a student working one month on smesmj this summer.
The world now knows (vaguely) that we work on MT, so we should do, as well.
We also need to work together with the external ones.

## All languages

**TODO:**
* Improve the sme-dis for MT purposes
* Go through the bilingual transfer lexica for more general translations
* Add alternative translations and selection rules
* Arrange an Apertium seminar (later)
* transfer hfst build infra from Apertium to Giellatekno

## finsme

Technical problems with compunds in Finnish: each part in the compound is
separated by a space character (+Ux20), which is creating problems in the
transfer.

**TODO**
* Tag unification
* Adp split in fin (**Trond**)

## smenob

Needed: Lexicon completion. Grammatical transfer rules

## smesmj

New worker underway.

## smesma

Infrastructure in place, to demo in Trondheim to encourage more work and
projects.

# CAT

**Ciprian** has made a translation memory based on our parallel corpus. The
test looks promising, he has identified certain issues. We need to be clear
about the license of the original parallel texts, and we need to know the
original language (ie translation direction).

**TODO:**
* make intelligent nobsme risten.no - requires `nob` morphology
    - nob.fst a la Trond
    - norskordbank.fst
    - nob.fst based on an xml source synchronised with Ordbanken source texts
    - should be coordinated with the Apertium analyser
* write a TM script to turn a parallell corpus into TM entries (**Ciprian**)
    - deadline: next Monday, 20.9.
* testing A-ITE on Norwegian Windows
    - done by our friends in RSA - bug identified, workaround sent by e-mail

# SMA seminar in August/September followup

**TODO:**
* update the XXE configuration to include the oahpa additions
  (**Ciprian, Sjur**)
    - done but not yet announced, needs user documentation first
* write user documentation (**Sjur**)

# Other

## Start to make yearly reports

Directory in svn in place, now we only need to fill it with content...

## Thursday inhouse seminar

Topic for this week: hfst + spelling + ocr (**Sjur**, perhaps **Lene**)

Next time suggestion list:
1. introduction to xslt - **Ciprian** to start out
    1.  relevant xslt issues:
    1.  basic principles of xslt …
    1.  sorting in xslt … (have a look at the dictionary sort xslt script)
    1.  converting from one xml format to another wilt xslt (sugg: convert from
    DivvunGT dictionary dtd to MacDict xml)

Future seminars:
1. XQuery
1. More XML (needs concretisation)
1. UML
1. other suggestions?
