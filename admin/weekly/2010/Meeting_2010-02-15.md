# Oahpa!

A lot of work for the Bodø version, but MorfaC needs more work.

Now all the Oahpa dev is done in $GTPRIV, it should be done in $GTHOME. The move
might be delayed till after the Bodø seminar.

A swedish-speaking guy would like to do the LexC translations into Swedish.

Meeting memos can be found at
[http://giellatekno.uit.no/ped/index.html#Meeting+memos]

# Corpus gathering

**Børre** talked to Ávvir two years ago. They had changed their publishing
system to an Adobe-based one which doesn't give direct access to articles as
individual files. Now the articles are stored in a database.

We should contact Ávvir to find out how to get text cooperation working again,
both regarding their article database (corpus) and their user dictionaries for
the spellers.

We also need to tighten the routines regarding the SD protocols, so that we get
all new protocols regularly.

Which books are digitized?
* These books should be OCR'ed/digitized: Anna Jacobsens books
 *Jupmele rïjhke lea gietskesne*,
 *Luste lohkedh*, *Duedtie Novrlaantesne*, *Naestie-tjoevkesne*,
 *Gullie-tjååtsele*.
* Its not digitized yet, should do it this week.
 A. Jacobsen: *Goltelidh jih soptestidh* and *Mojhtesh* are already
 in electronic form
* use the corpus gathering document to keep track of each book

**TODO:**
* continue gathering `sma` corpus texts (**Maja**)
    - get `sma` articles in Š-bláđđi
    - the Gun Utsi book is almost there - one contract missing (**Maja**)
* write formal letter to Davvi Girji (**Sjur**)
* send a copy of the signed contracts back to the authors, translators and
  publishers, accompanied by the thank-you letter
* find and contact the correct person in SD, to get the manuscript for all Sámi
  teaching material now being given out to the schools (**Sjur**)
* get the `sma` yearbooks from *Saemien sïjhte* (**Maja**)

# Promoting Divvun

**TODO:**
* make leaflet to inform about the project (**Børre**)
    - add InDesign text (**Sjur**)
    - make XSL script to transform Forrest XDocs to an OOo Drawer document
   (**Børre, Sjur**)
* distribute CD version through the library bus, the language centres and common
  sami centres in all of Sápmi. Gaaltije in Östersund for example.
  (**Leif Åge, Sjur**)
    - make him send out CD's accordingly (**Sjur**)
* update online download log statistics page (**Børre**)

# Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in `plan/strat/5year.jspwiki`.

## Northern areas project

**TODO:**
* Attend a beginners' course in Russian (priority: the alphabet!) near you..
* plan a meeting/seminar with potential cooperation partners (**Trond, Sjur**)
* plan for The Real Thing (**Trond, Sjur**)

# Infrastructure

## Makefile + tag simplification

**TODO:**
1. convert comment tags to real lexc tags when the discussion is over (**Tomi**)
    1. done
1. adjust gt/Makefile to grep on the new tags such that the old make targets work
  (**Tomi**)
    1. done (works without changes)
1. add the new tags to the tags-not-save.regex file (this will remove them from
  the regular analyzer) => the transducers and their output should be identical
  to the earlier versions (**Tomi**)
    1. done, but not tested
1. write new build commands (**Sjur, Tomi**)
1. when the new build infrastructure works as it should, delete the old ones
   (**Sjur, Tomi**)

## General list

To accommodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
    1. test bench enhanced, but not yet complete
1. improve Forrest i18n support with static sites
1. reorganise the documentation:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in Forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium](http://www.apertium.org/) and
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
1. update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

**TODO:**
* make the new SL Server services functional: (**Børre**)
    - Wiki, group calendars, address book server
        - wiki is done: [http://www.divvun.no/team/], an initial wiki can be found at
    [http://divvun.no/groups/divvunprojectpage/]
* Jabber server and group chats: user name issues + lost chat history
  (**Børre**)
* set up corpus mirroring on the XServe again (**Børre**)
    - not yet done - have a look at the script Saara made earlier
* restructure and clean the `script/` directory, using subdirs to categorise
  the scripts (**Ciprian**)
    - please act as suggested, cf comments in the news group
* infrastructure remake: (**Børre, Ciprian, Saara, Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)
    - more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
    - merge gt, kt and st into one
    - modularised preprocess and spellrelax
    - alternatives to make:
        - [SCons](http://www.scons.org/)
        - [makepp](http://makepp.sourceforge.net/)
        - [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (for java-projects)
        - [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) - **Sjur** looked at it, and have started to
    experiment
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* define and document testing routines (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process

# Linguistics

Hyphenation of loan words: **Thomas** would like to have a meeting about this
with **Maja, Trond, Lene**. He will send an e-mail about it.

## North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## South Sámi

Many words do not not follow Umlaut-rules:

Analyser output:

```
håjjedh+V+Ind+Prs+Pl3 (jamre, klage)
hejjieh
håjjoeh (- > hujjieh, according to Maja)
håjjah
```

* håjjedh e1 - hojjedh in use
* vearedh e1 - vïeredh in use

jmf: these are according to Umlaut-rules:
* bonnedh e1
* vïeredh e1 - v

Umlaut in derived verbs in adjectives does not not follow Umlaut-rules

Lexc solution:
1. one contlex for umlautverbs (for each class)
1. one contlex for nonumlautverbs
1. one contlex for directing to both (or merging to both)
 (for verbs with variation)

The third contlex could also be used to monitor behaviour, with
tags +Uml +Nouml.

Numerals:
* Bergsland, and Spiik for smj as well: gøøkte luhkie gøøkte
* Majja, and Nickel for sme: gøøkteluhkiegøøkte
* Tronds interpretation: Bergsland and Spiik do not reflect the norm, but a
  pedagogical convention to make it easier for readers to understand

Three types of problem areas:
* missing closed POSes: errors in transducer, or in PL conversion
* missing words found in the smanob dictionary: 110 verbs, 80 adjectives, all
  core `sma` words (**Cip**: this statistics is NOT complete, as far as I know
  Trond has forgotten to take the Swedish verb file into account!)
* missing list from corpus

We also seem to have problems with derivations:
```
jealadehtedh   jieliedehtedh	jieledh+V+Der1+Der/dehte+V+Inf
galmadehtedh   galmedehtedh	galmedidh+V+Der2+Der/ehte+V+Inf
```

About the sma school conference: we'll ask them about their promise from last
year, and decide what to do based on their response. Initial decision is to go
there.

**TODO:**
* Prepare text´s about normativity issue to SGL/SGM (**Maja, Thomas**)
* adjectives (**Maja** with **Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
    - two competing naming conventions of continuation lexicons
        - One naming goes ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE
        - One follows the sme convention of naming key adjectives
        - There are duplicate lexica
    - The comparative issue open here and there
        - The ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE lexica now go to EVENCOMP and
    ODDCOMP only.
* add compound tags (**Thomas**)
* write letter to Fylkesmannen i Nordland (**Sjur**)
* check verb Umlaut for several verbs (**Maja, Sjur,Thomas, Trond**)

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

**Tomi** has played with [couchdb](http://couchdb.apache.org/) as a replacement
for eXist in risten.no and general dictionary-related work. Seems much lighter
and easier to work with.

Instead of building our own webforms and back-end update scripts, use XForms
with a premade connection to our xml db. Orbeon XForms is such a tool (open
source).

From the meeting with the terminology and IT teams last week:
* no major rework on the present search interface now
* no work on the editing section; instead:
* add existing lists of sanctioned terminology as separate term entities
* add a dictionary if we can make one with sufficient quality

This means the following tasks:
* find already approved lists, in paper or electronic form (**term team**)
* convert paper lists to electronic lists (**term team**)
* convert lists to standard XML (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add prepared lists to risten.no (**Sjur, Tomi**)

**TODO:**
1. send eXist log files to Ciprian (**Sjur**)
    1. done
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add `nob`
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
  the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
  to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
  official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

All Oahpa! now - no dictionaries:)

fkv:nob and nob:fkv is scheduled to be released at March 18th.
The doublet-removal work is ongoing (appr. 200 left),
thereafter 225 pos=x should be added, so there might be more doublets.

What will be released is a two-way dictionary without morphology.
The nice-to-have feature would be a web interface in addition to
the StarDict and MacDict ones, but really as an extra, eventual
bonus only.

**TODO:**
* fkv:nob and nob:fkv scheduled for 18.3. release:
    - content and webpage update (**Trond, Verena**)
    - compile the MacDict and StarDict versions (**Ciprian**)
* kom:fin-eng
    - moved the original kom-lex.xml to the inc-dir and froze it
    - split it by pos into the working_file dir, the ONLY place to work with
   the dictionary entries
    - now, the lexC files are generated via XSLT sheets, no perl scripts
    - adjusted the Makefile
    - prepared the pipeline for compiling the mac dict
    - todo: make a pipeline for StarDict also (as far as I know, **Jaska** has)
   a Linux machine
* set up risten.no on eXist/XServe (as a beta version site) (**Sjur**)
* set up required infra for smenob on risten.no/XServe (**Sjur**)
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* end user documentation (how to download and install) (**Ciprian, Trond**)
* Contact *Davvi Girji* about cooperation on electronic dictionaries
  (**Sjur**)
* developing the mobile phone version of smenob:
    - http://pfed.info/wksite/
* Komi
    - take out the doublets to a separate file (**Ciprian**)
    - merge the doublets (**Jaska, Trond**)
    - Completing the automaton to some state (**Trond, Jaska, Paula**)

# Proofing tools

## South Sámi

**TODO:**
* Go through the phonrules file (**Thomas**)
* difftest for fst and PL speller (**Sjur**)
* External beta testers:
    - David
    - Jovsset
    - the Røros group
* gold standard testing (**Sjur**)

## HFST-based proofing tools

The work with Voikko+HFST is slowly moving forward.

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* test new and nested error markup (**Sjur**)
    - nesting still needs to be tested, depends on new `ccat` feature

### Speller testing

**TODO:**
* test the error type selection feature in ccat (**Sjur**)

### Testing open-source Norwegian spellers

**Sjur** has invited the open-source group to test their spell-checker using our
test bench. The response has been positive, we'll see what happens.

We should go to their developer meetings, and present our work and how to work
with language technology.

## Speller bugs

List of bugs returned from Polderland:
* 621

Open issues based on test results :

### sme
Lexicon version: **Davvisámi, version 1.2, 2009-09-18**

No known issues!

### smj
Lexicon version: **Julevsáme, version 1.2, 2009-09-20**
* 670 - Hard hyphen replaced with soft hyphen: *10-biejvvásattja* (the word is
        not rec.; Bug #711) - still **OPEN**

### sma

Command to test the hyphenator:

```
preprocess dev/corp/pressemelding.txt | lookup bin/hyph-sma.fst | cut -f2 | \
lookup bin/hyphrules-sma.fst | grep -v '^$' | cut -f2 | uniq | see
```

**TODO:**
* fix PL hyphenator errors (**Tomi**)
    - almost done - one `smj` bug left

## Installer changes

**TODO:**
* test InDesign installer (**Sjur**)

## User documentation

**TODO:**
* InDesign documentation (**Sjur**)
    - Norwegian translation received from Davvi Girji

## 1.2 release

Content:
* several smj bug fixes

* Ciprian on dictionary compilation (already done)
* Trond on a project inventory (aka "A little bit about everything")
* last time: next session will be about grep and its closest friends
  (fgrep, egrep)

## Spring planning

Topics:

* speller test project -> Sjur, Børre, Thomas, X
* speech synthesis -> Sjur, Trond, BA as a starter
* risten.no -> Ciprian, Sjur, Tomi
* Barents project follow-up meeting -> Trond, Sjur

Dates:

* Feb. 15: ACL Deadline
* March 1-14: Bodø
* March 23-24: SMA school conference, Trondheim
* May : LREC Malta
* July: ACL Uppsala

## Text to speech

We need to put the preprocessing pieces together, ie all the bits that will turn
regular texts into decent input for the synthesizer.

Files:

1. sme/src/sme-num.txt for numeral to text
1. ... for abbreviation to text (not done(?))
1. sme/src/phon-sme.xfst for text to IPA/Sampa

Present output of sme-num.fst:

```
3
3	golbma

23.2.
23.2.	 guovvamánu guoktelogigoalmmát beaivi
23.2.	guoktelogigolbma čuokkis nubbi

23.02.2010
23.02.2010	 guovvamánu guoktelogigoalmmát beaivi guokteduhátlogi

10:32
10:32	logi kolon golbmalogiguokte
```

We would like to have POS tagging as well, and perhaps
intonation grammar (focus phrase detection)

First POS tagging and text processing
The last step: conversion to Sampa.

**TODO:**
* put together the preprocessing transducers and scripts (**Tomi**)
* refine syntax / dependency rules (**Biret Ánne**)
* start public tender process (**Sjur**)
    - started
* find appropriate voices (**Biret Ánne**)
    - done

## CAT

Autshumato ITE won't work on the Mac because of Apple software security
policies. It still works fine on Windows and Linux, and could possibly be used
at the Sámi Parliament.

# Next meeting, closing

The next meeting is 22.2.2010, 9.30 Norwegian time.

Next week: Ciprian is in Berlin next week, and returning on the following
Sunday. Sjur is taking winter holidays, but will try to work in the afternoons.
