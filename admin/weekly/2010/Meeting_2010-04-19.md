## General list

Now that we have the FIN-CG from Fred Karlsson, we also need a way of integrating Omorfi in a proper way with our svn repository. External references could be one alternative. We have to find a way of doing this consistently, there might be other code repositories we want to integrate with as well (e.g. Apertium).

Meänkieli adaptions in our infrastructure.

Requirements:
* separate Subversion repository
* structured roughly as our main repository (but without the less optimal parts:) )
* limited access to the closed repo, in the sense that one language group should not be able to see the work of another language group (exception for administrators) - otherwise it isn't really secret/closed. That is, the FIT gang should only see FIT files, and a hypothetical e.g. Estonian gang should only see the Estonian files, not the FIT files, etc. But to the extent that there are (links to) shared resources the (e.g. links to infrastructure things in another place), they should be visible to all groups
* all tools, dtd's, configs work as in and from the main Subverison, such that we don't end up with multiple copies. That is, only content files and no infrastructure files should be in the closed repo - all the rest should stay in the main repo
* we should have scripts that move a full language dir from one repo to the other, in both directions, keeping svn history etc.
* the amount of work for setting this up should be minimal, or we have to ask them for money

Tentative task list
* figure out the svn dir structure in the closed lang repo, set it up
* figure out how to make the infrastructure in the open/main repo available for work in the closed repo (we want to have only one dtd, one XXE config, one makefile, etc.)
* when we have an idea of the amount of work, decide whether we just do it, or whether we bill them
* implement the previous point
* transfer the language files, preferably using a script for automatic transfer and deletion in the open repo
* inform them about the changes

To accommodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
    1. test bench enhanced, but not yet complete
1. improve Forrest i18n support with static sites
1. reorganise the documentation:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in Forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium](http://www.apertium.org/) and
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
1. update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

**TODO:**
* make the new SL Server services functional: (**Børre**)
    - group calendars
* set up corpus mirroring on the XServe again (**Børre**)
* restructure and clean the `script/` directory, using subdirs to categorise
  the scripts (**Ciprian**)
    - started
* infrastructure remake: (**Børre, Ciprian, Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)
    - more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
    - merge gt, kt and st into one
    - modularised preprocess and spellrelax
    - alternatives to make:
        - [SCons](http://www.scons.org/)
        - [makepp](http://makepp.sourceforge.net/)
        - [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (for java-projects)
        - [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) - **Sjur** looked at it, and have started to
    experiment
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* define and document testing routines (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* meeting to discuss the FIT request for closed repository tomorrow at 9.30

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## South Sámi

**TODO:**
* Prepare texts about normativity issue to SGL/SGM (**Maja**)
    - look at Trond's XXX comments (**Maja**)
    - read through and comment by Wednesday afternoon (**Sjur**)
* adjectives (**Maja** with **Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
    - two competing naming conventions of continuation lexicons
        - One naming goes ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE
        - One follows the `sme` convention of naming key adjectives
        - There are duplicate lexica
    - The comparative issue open here and there
        - The ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE lexica now go to EVENCOMP and
    ODDCOMP only.
* finish compound tags for adjectives (**Maja**)

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

**TODO:**
* find already approved lists, in paper or electronic form (**term team**)
* convert paper lists to electronic lists (**term team**)
* convert lists to standard XML (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add prepared lists to risten.no (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
* fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
* finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
* test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
* make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add `nob`
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
* convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
* implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
  the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
  to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
  official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
* start to use the xml file as source file
* clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, linguists**)
* merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
* publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
* add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
* add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

    - prepared the pipeline for compiling the mac dict
    - todo: make a pipeline for StarDict also (as far as I know, **Jaska** has)
   a Linux machine
* set up risten.no on eXist/XServe (as a beta version site) (**Sjur**)
* set up required infra for smenob on risten.no/XServe (**Sjur**)

# Proofing tools

## South Sámi

Beta release: June 1. We should be getting the Polderland (now Knowledge Concepts) binaries in the second half of May.

**TODO:**
* difftest for fst and PL speller (**Sjur**)
* External beta testers:
    - David
    - Jovsset
    - the Røros group
* gold standard testing (**Sjur**)

## HFST-based proofing tools

The work with Voikko+HFST is moving forward.

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* test new and nested error markup (**Sjur**)
    - nesting still needs to be tested, depends on new `ccat` feature

### Speller testing

**TODO:**
* test the error type selection feature in ccat (**Sjur**)

### Testing open-source Norwegian spellers

**Sjur** has invited the open-source group to test their spell-checker using our
test bench. The response has been positive, we'll see what happens.

We should go to their developer meetings, and present our work and how to work
with language technology.

## Speller bugs

## CAT

Autshuhamo-ITE is now available, and we want to set up a proof-of-concept server
to demonstrate how we (soon) can provide a translator's workbench with
integrated machine translation (and also dictionary and terminology content).

Apertium installed at:
```
/opt/MT/
/opt/MT/apertium3.0.4
```

Apertium is working in victorio, with one dirty fix: I had to make the following link:
* local/bin/cg-proc -> /usr/local/bin/cg-proc

```
apertium-nn-nb$echo ikke |apertium -d . nb-nn
ikkje
```

**TODO:**
* test Apertium integration with A-ITE (**Ciprian, Sjur**)
* convert our dictionaries to A-ITE format, so that they can be used directly in
  there

## Norsk språkbank
Sámi will form a  part of Norsk språkbank. We should consider candidates
for pilot content (preferably terminology or bilingual text) for a first
presentation of Språkbanken.
