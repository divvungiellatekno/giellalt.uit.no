!!!Corpus gathering

National Library: there is a meeting in September, to which Trond is going.
Trond will request a couple of Sámi OCR-ed texts (together with the {{nob}}
texts we already have), and use them as test cases for spell-checking and
(automatically) correcting the OCR-ed texts.

This work should be incorporated in the test bench project, and serve as a
basis for developing a better {{nob}} (and potentially {{nno}} as well)
morphologies, to be used in our different projects. The main project,
developing an OCR-adapted Norwegian spell-checker (as open source) should be
financed by the Language bank.

There are starting points both in our own svn and in Apertium, both based on
the lexicons from UiO/Norsk ordbank.

Our main goal with this would be to help the Language bank and the Natinal 
Library provide us with usable Sámi (and possibly Norwegian) corpus material,
but there are a number of other secondary goals and positive side effects of
this as well.

__TODO:__
* get all the latest Sámi Parliament protocolls into our repository (__Børre__)
** mostly done, protocolls from the period 2006-2010/1 do not seem to be
   translated into {{sme}} - Børre will check this
* contact the Sámi translators at the government and ministeries to get more
  parallell texts (__Børre__)
* continue gathering {{sma}} corpus texts (__Maja__)
** get {{sma}} articles in Š-bláđđi
** the Gun Utsi book is almost there - one contract missing (__Maja__)
* write formal letter to Davvi Girji (__Sjur__)
* send a copy of the signed contracts back to the authors, translators and 
  publishers, accompanied by the thank-you letter
* find and contact the correct person in SD, to get the manuscript for all Sámi
  teaching material now being given out to the schools (__Sjur__)
* get the {{sma}} yearbooks from ''Saemien sïjhte'' (__Maja__)
* contact certain {{sma}} writers (__Børre__)
* contact Inga Margrethe Bjørn Eira (__Maja__)
* give Maja a WebSak intro (__Børre__)
* restart the letter mailing thing using WebSak (__Maja__)

!!!Promoting Divvun

__Rune Fjelheim__ suggested last week that we should start a separate project
to inform about, teach about and install our language technology tools (not 
only Divvun). This would also make a very good feedback channel.

__TODO:__
* make leaflet to inform about the project (__Børre__)
** add InDesign text (__Sjur__)
** make XSL script to transform Forrest XDocs to an OOo Drawer document
   (__Børre, Sjur__)
* distribute CD version through the library bus, the language centres and
  common sami centres in all of Sápmi. Gaaltije in Östersund for example.
  (__Leif Åge, Sjur__)
** make him send out CD's accordingly (__Sjur__)
* update online download log statistics page (__Børre__)

!!!Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in {{plan/strat/5year.jspwiki}}.

!!Northern areas project

First major obstacle: make working keyboards and fonts.
In principle, there are two approaches to keyboards:

# Make the Russian-based keyboards work
# Design new Kildin-optimized keyboards

The first goal has priority. We should have text analysis in order to consider
whether the second goal is feasible. Trond to follow up test machines.

* Choice of fonts
* Rendering of fonts in MS Word and other important programs
* Keyboard layout
** Empirical phase: What keyboards are around
** Design phase: Make the optimal keyboards -- for all OSes

Write trustworthy and detailed documentation (in Russian)

What we know:
* you can type on some computers (Michael R: it works), not on others. Q: what
  are the differences between the two types of computers?
* some fonts can't display the chars, others can (but usually ugly)

__TODO:__
* Course plan for meeting/seminar, october. Financing must be in place.
** check the time needed to tet visas with the UiT admin (__Trond__)
** call the ministry (__Trond__)
* Attend a beginners' course in Russian (priority: the alphabet!) near you..
* make a plan for the first two years, update overall plan (__Trond, Sjur__)
* Follow up Windows test machines

!!!Infrastructure

Out of the box experiences:
* fao could not be compiled out of the box (the Oslo gang tried) because of a
  missing {{tmp}} dir
* our list of software to install is incomplete or lacking installation
  instructions
* external tools require manual installation
* there are bugs in the gtsetup.sh script

!!Updated corpus online

See __Ciprian´s__ document about the corpus content in
{{$GTPRIV/plan/corpus/oslo_corpus_update_todo.txt}}.

Issues:
* filenames
* organisation of subdirs?
* content (or lack thereof) of original and converted files
* svn repo reorganisation

{{{
facta$convert2xml.pl --nolog --corpdir=/usr/local/share/corp L1allOrt.correct.txt
}}}

Error message:
{{{
sh: /home/sjur/gtmain/gt/script/text_cat: No such file or directory
L1allOrt.correct.txt: ERROR errors in /home/sjur/gtmain/gt/script/text_cat -q \
   -x -d /home/sjur/gtmain/gt/script/LM "/usr/local/share/corp/tmp/L1allOrt.correct.txt.tmp0": 
}}}

{{text_cat}} isn't part of our repository, we need to add it - we are using a
modified version of the original file. It should be added with a short README
and some license info, pointing to the original.

__TODO:__
* make the conversion scripts work with the new svn repository
  (__Børre, Ciprian__)
** add check for almost empty content
*** already implemented in convert2xml.pl. Still empty or almost empty files
    are converted. This is because of unexpected structure of content, so that
    the conversion goes wrong, and leaves no real content in the resulting xml
    file.
** add processing of svg files
*** not done
* reorganise subdirs as needed (__Ciprian, Trond__)
** not yet done
* identify parallel nob files - should be automatic, but needs to be checked
  (__Ciprian__)
* sentence-align sme with nob (__Ciprian__)
** the aligner wasn't working, __Børre__ has tried to fix it
*** not yet fixed - bug not found
* analyse/disambiguate (__Ciprian__)
* preferably also dep -> check with Oslo if it can be used (__Ciprian__)
* install in Oslo (__Ciprian, Trond__)
* add better handling of unknown strings in our analysers (__???__)

!!Corpus infra remake

__Ciprian__ has moved all code relating to {{convert2xml.pl}} to a subfolder.
Still needs testing especially on victorio.

__TODO:__
* convert or move the files in the {{upload}} dir to the real corpus repo
  (__Børre__)
** almost finished, moved files to both {{bound/}} and {{free/}}, will soon
   write documentation on how to use the new corpus infra
* turn on corpus summary crontab (__Børre__)
* needs to check the conversion from old rcs corpus repository to new svn-based
  repository (__Ciprian__)
* add checkout of the free corpus to the gtsetup.sh script (__Børre, Sjur__)
* add checkout of the bound corpus when on victorio (__Børre, Sjur__)
* add updates of free & bound to the svnup alias (__Børre__)

!!License

__TODO:__
* install & configure the Unison news reader (__Sjur__)

!!Corpus interface

This depends on the infrastructure cleanup.

__TODO:__
* make a simple web search form for the UiT corpus repository (__Ciprian, X__)
* check out the new version of CWB with Unicode support (__Ciprian__)
** fall

!!Makefile + tag simplification

Problems with the proofing tools compilation, now solved.

__TODO:__
# test the new build commands (__Sjur, Trond, Lene, Thomas__)
## kommando: {{make TARGET=sme NEW-fst}} etc.
## test by comparing the output of the old and new analysers - it should be
   identical. Test both analysis and generation (ie all your favourite
   usecases)
# when the new build infrastructure works as it should, delete the old ones
   (__Sjur, Tomi__)
## tests seem fine: Thursday morning August 19, Tomi will implement this.

!!HFST compilation

Our HFST transducers do still contain all the extra tags resulting from the tag
conversion (cf above). The Apertium versions do not, however. The main problem
here is the forking of smi transducer builing and maintenance - one branch in 
Giellatekno, and another in Apertium. This is not good for future maintenance,
and should be corrected ASAP. The tag-removing make steps should be
incorporated in the giellatekno svn.

!!General list

Meänkieli adaptions in our infrastructure.

Requirements:
* separate Subversion repository
* structured roughly as our main repository
* limited access to the closed repo, in the sense that one language group
  should not be able to see the work of another language group (exception for
  administrators) - otherwise it isn't really secret/closed. That is, the FIT
  gang should only see FIT files, and a hypothetical e.g. Estonian gang should
  only see the Estonian files, not the FIT files, etc. But to the extent that
  there are (links to) shared resources the (e.g. links to infrastructure
  things in another place), they should be visible to all groups
* all tools, dtd's, configs work as in and from the main Subversion, such that
  we don't end up with multiple copies. That is, only content files and no
  infrastructure files should be in the closed repo - all the rest should stay
  in the main repo
* we should have scripts that move a full language dir from one repo to the
  other, in both directions, keeping svn history etc.
* the amount of work for setting this up should be minimal, or we have to ask
  them for money

Tentative task list
* figure out the svn dir structure in the closed lang repo, set it up
* figure out how to make the infrastructure in the open/main repo available for
  work in the closed repo (we want to have only one dtd, one XXE config, one
  makefile, etc.)
* when we have an idea of the amount of work, decide whether we just do it, or
  whether we bill them
* implement the previous point
* transfer the language files, preferably using a script for automatic transfer
  and deletion in the open repo
* inform them about the changes

To accommodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

# test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
## test bench enhanced, but not yet complete
# improve Forrest i18n support with static sites
# reorganise the documentation:
## differ between target groups
## get better grouping
## decide what to write in Forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium|http://www.apertium.org/] and 
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
## update/add missing parts
# migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
## Name lexica (the Name project)
## Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
## At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
# change the look of the documentation web
# corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
# update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

__TODO:__
* add Apertium to the XServe (__Børre__)
* make the new SL Server services functional: (__Børre__)
** group calendars
* set up corpus mirroring on the XServe again (__Børre__)
** on victorio, all files are checked out and converted in
   {{/home/apache_corpus/boundcorpus|freecorpus/converted}}
* finish the restructuring  and cleaning of the {{script/}} directory
  __Ciprian__)
* infrastructure remake: (__Børre, Ciprian, Sjur, Tomi, Trond__)
** more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
*** look at omorfi for ideas of how to modularise
** merge gt, kt and st into one
** modularised preprocess and spellrelax
** alternatives to make:
*** [SCons|http://www.scons.org/]
*** [makepp|http://makepp.sourceforge.net/]
*** [Maven|http://maven.apache.org/] (for java-projects)
*** [CMake|http://www.cmake.org/] - __Sjur__ looked at it, and have started to
    experiment
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (__Ciprian, Sjur, Trond__)
** delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* define and document testing routines (__Ciprian, Sjur, Trond__)
** delayed until we have restructured the make/build process

!!!Linguistics

!!North Sámi

There are a lot of hyphens found in noun paradigms. They should not be there.
Trond and Thomas will look into them.

__TODO:__
* check extra hyphens in the sme lexc continuations (__Thomas, Trond__)

!!Lule Sámi

__TODO:__
* check extra hyphens in the smj lexc continuations (__Thomas, Trond__)

!!South Sámi

__TODO:__
* read through and comment by Wednesday afternoon (__Sjur__)
* adjectives (__Maja__ with __Thomas, Trond, Sjur__)
** two competing naming conventions of continuation lexicons
*** One naming goes ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE
*** One follows the {{sme}} convention of naming key adjectives
*** There are duplicate lexica
** The comparative issue open here and there
*** The ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE lexica now go to EVENCOMP and
    ODDCOMP only.
* finish compound tags for adjectives (__Maja__)

!!!Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

__Sjur__ made a budget for risten2 with great help from Ciprian and Trond.

__TODO:__
* make budget proposal to the SD (__Ciprian, Sjur__)
* find already approved lists, in paper or electronic form (__term team__)
* convert paper lists to electronic lists (__term team__)
* convert lists to standard XML (__Sjur, Tomi__)
* add prepared lists to risten.no (__Sjur, Tomi__)
* fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (__Sjur__)
* fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (__Saara__)
* finish first version of the editing (__Sjur__)
* test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (__Sjur, Thomas, Trond__)
* make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add
  {{nob}} as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (__Sjur, Saara__)
* convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (__Sjur, Tomi, Saara__)
* implement data synchronisation between [risten.no|http://www.risten.no] and
  the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
  to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
  official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
* start to use the xml file as source file
* clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (__Thomas, linguists__)
* merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (__linguists__)
* publish the name lexicon on risten.no (__Sjur__)
* add missing parallel names for placenames (__linguists__)
* add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (__linguists__)

!!Dictionaries

__Ciprian__ has made a proposal for unifying Oahpa and general dictionary
formats into one DTD.

StarDict is useless for Cyrillic languages, mainly because of the scanning
function (ie point and look-up). We need to find an alternative to StarDict.
Also, the Kildin Sámi users have different needs than we have had in mind. And
they don't have access to a Kildin Sámi keyboard in Windows.

* we need a Russian Windows machine, bought in Russia, using the software they
  use
* we also of course need a western/Norwegian Windows machine for testing

Released:
* SME:NOB update release

Other things dictionary-related:
* risten.no data as part of our dictionaries
* dictionaries as part of risten.no
* dictionaries and risten.no as part of Autshumato ITE

__TODO:__
* kom:fin-eng
** moved the original kom-lex.xml to the inc-dir and froze it
** split it by pos into the working_file dir, the ONLY place to work with
   the dictionary entries
** now, the lexC files are generated via XSLT sheets, no perl scripts
** adjusted the Makefile
** prepared the pipeline for compiling the mac dict
** todo: make a pipeline for StarDict also (as far as I know, __Jaska__ has)
   a Linux machine
* set up risten.no on eXist/XServe (as a beta version site) (__Sjur__)
* set up required infra for smenob on risten.no/XServe (__Sjur__)
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (__Ciprian, Sjur, Trond__)
* end user documentation (how to download and install) (__Ciprian, Trond__)
* Contact ''Davvi Girji'' about cooperation on electronic dictionaries
  (__Sjur__)
* developing the mobile phone version of smenob:
** [http://pfed.info/wksite/]
* Komi
** take out the doublets to a separate file (__Ciprian__)
** merge the doublets (__Jaska, Trond__)
** Completing the automaton to some state (__Trond, Jaska, Paula__)
* make the sort XSL script available for all languages to keep the source files
  sorted

!!!Proofing tools

Spelling feedback from Malta:
* use FST to model suggestions (Krister et al)
* Lene is evaluating the output of the Polderland speller
** first-letter errors rare, but the PLX speller still changes it quite often
** Oahpa and Divvun approaching each other
* using Wikipedia as a source for spelling errors and test material (a French
  group has made a setup of tools to automatise most of this)

!!South Sámi

Beta release: Aug 25. Contract now ok by Knowledge Concepts. Suggested
timetable sent this morning.

!!HFST- and Voikko-based proofing tools

__Sjur__ met with the HFST people yesterday. Two things happening in parallell:
# hfst3 - being made ready for public release, with proper inclusion of
          autotools, and updated documentation
# speller/lookup library:
## speller/lookup library
## voikko integration of this library

__TODO:__
* Change the license tag to GPL for voikko inclusion. (see above)
** done

!!!Nordplus Språk proofing test bench project

Arno Teigseth is hired for the summer. He is sitting in Equador, 7 hours after
Norway. He is working with a quechua speller (using hunspell) and dictionary.

A goal is to use texts from parallel domains, in order to be
able to compare nob and sme. We start out with 100000 words, 5000
for each genre:
# Discussion fora on the net
# Blogs

Discussion fora can be problematic, as they contain a lot of very oral language
with deliberate oral or dialectal forms used in the text. As such, the texts
won't be typical for the kind of texts people would like to spell-check, and
thus the genre is problematic for the purpose at hand.

Possible other genres:
# Minutes from local associations
# Pupil texts - look for the home pages of the schools
# exam texts by 10th grade pupils, where the pupils have published the texts
  themselves
# skrivebua - Nordland fylkeskommune: all three Sámi languages

!!!Text to speech

There will be regular meetings in this project from now on, every second week.

__TODO:__
* put together the preprocessing transducers and scripts (__Tomi__)
* refine syntax / dependency rules (__Biret Ánne__)
* continue public tender process (__Sjur__)

!!!Machine Translation

Background:

Kevin and Ryan have now closed the work on smenob and finsme. They will
continue, but mainly do other things. As for smesmj, the possible student
input is rescheduled for October.

We hope to have a student working one month on smesmj this summer.
The world now knows (vaguely) that we work on MT, so we should do, as well.
We also need to work together with the external ones.

!!All languages

__TODO__

* Set up hfst and apertium for all relevant machines 
* Improve the sme-dis for MT purposes
* Go through the bilingual transfer lexica for more general translations
* Add alternative translations and selection rules
* Arrange an Apertium seminar (later)
* transfer hfst build infra from Apertium to Giellatekno

!!finsme

Technical problems with compunds in Finnish: each part in the compound is
separated by a space character (+Ux20), which is creating problems in the
transfer.

__TODO__
* Tag unification
* Adp split in fin (__Trond__)

!!smenob

Needed: Lexicon completion. Grammatical transfer rules

!!smesmj

New worker underway.

!!smesma

Infrastructure in place, to demo in Trondheim to encourage more work and
projects.

!!!CAT

__Ciprian__ has made a translation memory based on our parallel corpus. The
test looks promising, he has identified certain issues. We need to be clear
about the license of the original parallel texts, and we need to know the
original language (ie translation direction).

__TODO:__
* make intelligent nobsme risten.no - requires {{nob}} morphology
** nob.fst a la Trond
** norskordbank.fst
** nob.fst based on an xml source synchronised with Ordbanken source texts
** should be coordinated with the Apertium analyser
* write a TM script to turn a parallell corpus into TM entries
** testing A-ITE on Norwegian Windows

!!!SMA seminar in August/September

* Place: Trondheim
* Date: 30.8.-3.9.

Theme:
* editing dictionaries
* beta tools for {{sma}}
* orthographic questions

__TODO:__
* book lunch, coffee
* make a list of participants (12 + 5 + 3) in {{$GTPRIV/}} (__Maja__)
** done
* call a select few that have not answered but that we want there (__Maja__)
** done
* preparations:
** test installation of all needed software (__Ciprian, Børre__)
** test XMLEditor on Windows, including plugin installation
   (__Ciprian, Børre__)
*** plugin/configuration not yet tested, will need an installation batch/shell
    script for Windows
** try to work out a unified DTD for dictionaries and Oahpa (or augment the
   general dictionary DTD with Oahpa-required features) (__Ciprian__)
** sma Divvun beta - see above

!!!Other

!!Start to make yearly reports

__TODO__
* Set up a catalogue in plan/ (__Trond__)

!!Thursday inhouse seminar

Next time suggestion list: 
# introduction to xslt - __Ciprian__ to start out
##  relevant xslt issues:
##  basic principles of xslt …
##  sorting in xslt … (have a look at the dictionary sort xslt script)
##  converting from one xml format to another wilt xslt (sugg: convert from
    DivvunGT dictionary dtd to MacDict xml)

Future seminars:
# XQuery
# More XML (needs concretisation)
# UML
# other suggestions?
