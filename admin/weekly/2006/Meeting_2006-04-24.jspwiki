!!!3. Documentation

  (__Børre__)
**  The item will be moved to the TODO list, again.

!!!4. Corpus gathering

!! Trip to Sámi municipalities and ,,,,

Børre is going to a trip to Karasjok, Tana, Nesseby, Utsjoki and Inari, to visit the municipalities, parliaments and Sámi Council. In Karasjok he will try to visit Davvi Girji as well.

!!Collecting

See a [previous meeting memo|Meeting_2006-01-16] for what's to be done.

TODO: Send out the rest of the letters (__Børre__)


!!Odin

__Sæth__ replied by e-mail, hasn't had time to follow-up, but will try to
include us in their plans.

* __Børre__ will weekly mirror the URL mentioned in Sæths e-mail, 
  and add missing files to the corpus.
  
!!Olavi Korhonen's Lule Sámi dictionary.

* No news this week

TODO: __Børre__ to contact Olavi Korhonen and Kuhmunen

!! KIO Grafisk and the Iđut books

__TODO__:
* send letters to the authors (__Børre__)
* wait for the discussions with Davvi Girji
**  A talk with Brita Kåven, revealed that they would have a look at
    the contracts __after__ easter.

!!Bible texts

We will get text from Finland, but still haven't received any. We have got the
Swedish text from Sweden. As for the last html versions from Norway, __Trond__
has not contacted them last week. 

Swedish html has arrived, no paratext. Norsk bibelselskap has not sent 
corrected New Testament versions for sme, and not paratext for nno/nob.

TODO:
* convert smj NT to paratext (__Børre__)
**  Not done
* get fin, swe, nob and nno NT and OT in __paratext__ format. (__Trond__)
**  No news

!!Min Áigi

Everything ok here.

__TODO__:
* __Børre__ to contact __Per Christian Biti__ on technical issues (how to transfer texts).

!!Kåfjord

Promised to send us texts, but nothing has arrived yet.

__TODO__: __Børre__ to contact them.

!!Sámi Instituhtta

Audhild Schanche has signed the contract. We will have to contact them about transferring the texts. 

__TODO__: __Børre__ to contact them.

!!!5. Corpus infrastructure

https://giellalt.uit.no/lang/corp/corpus-summary.html

TODO:

!!Changes and updates because of the Divvun public tender

User account admin and infra: see [previous
  memo|/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-06.html].

TODO: see above under ''Documentation.''

Automatic build of the content of our corpus repo: also see [previous
  memo|/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-06.html].

TODO:
* make free texts available
** done weekly by a cron script (but only if there are new files) (__Saara__)
* Make a link, easily available, to these texts.

!!Free and non-free texts

More info in a [previous meeting
memo.|/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-13.html]

TODO:
* Check the status of the texts, again. (__Børre, Trond__)
* Rerun the conversion afterwards (__Saara__ is the one with the magic spell)

!!Linking parallel files

DECISION:
We'll keep the original filename, and store linking info in the header (has to
be added manually).

TODO:
* develop the web interface for uploading to make it easier to add several
  documents in one go. (__Saara__)

!!More texts to the graphical corpus interface:

TODO:
* We would like to have more than the NT in the graphical interface http://omilia.uio.no/CE/sami/ (__Saara__)
** We add the largest texts first.
* We would like to have grammatical searchability, not only POS. (__Saara__,
  __Trond__)
* This presupposes a discussion with Oslo. (__Trond__ and __Saara__ to continue this discussion)
* For Lule Sámi: We would like to have a parallel corpus interface with NT
  (text only). This presupposes better quality texts (__Trond, Børre__)
** Better Lule NT text still not made.
* The list of good candicates: The longest (admin) texts.
** We need a ccat version of the script for analysing text, still keeping xml tags. (__Tomi__).

Top-two priorities:
# Trond and Saara to discuss with Lars.
# Lars to add text to the server.
# Tomi to prepare for the parallel corpus.

!!Language recognition

TODO:
* turn on language recognition, skipping Finnish (__Saara__)
** Done, it seems.
Short word list
Trond to make such lists.

some flag to write into the xsl file:
* method:do not run lg recognition
* method:Choose between these 2:nob, sme

TODO: __Saara__ to implement this and to write a short documentation on how to write in the appropriate commands in the file-specifix xsl documents.

!!!6. Infrastructure

!!Aligner

Today, we have two anchor files in addition to the original one. 

TODO:
* Read documentation and try out, give feedback to Bergen. (__Trond__,
  __Saara__, __Tomi__)
* conflate nno with nob into 'nor' (__Trond__)
**  Partly done, must go through and see.
* __Saara__ to install the aligner, everyone to read the documentation
* __Trond__ and __Saara__ will continue this issue.

!!Hyphenator

Trond and Thomas have been updating the propernoun file with ^ tags. We need the tag in front of compound parts beginning in a vowel or in two or more consonants. Compound parts beginning with one consonant are handled correctly.

TODO:
* Remove the ^ signs from the UPPER level (just like the TV and IV tags are
  removed today. (__Trond__)
* Otherwise we wait with the following items until Sjur is back.
* correct hyphenation of word boundaries and exceptions (__Sjur, Trond__)
* add a possibility to upload whole documents for hyphenation (and also
  analysis, generation, etc) (__Saara__)
* we should log all and every word/text uploaded/hyphenated/analyzed etc
** we'll do it, but it does not have first priority (__Saara__)

!!!7. Linguistics

!!General - hyphenation

See discussion, open questions and decission in the [previous meeting
memo.|/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-04-03.html]

TODO:
* add all word boundaries (__Thomas__)
**  Done: All sme except propernoun-file. Trond has gone through the propernoun
    file and added ^ marks for the most common name elements, such as fjell, 
    fjord, but there is still more to be done. Thomas has done 
    propernoun-file A-N.
* Set up the mechanism for the hash transducer package. (__Sjur, Tomi, Trond__)
** Not done, let us wait until Sjur is back.

TODO:
* Thomas and Trond to carry on marking ^ on the compound parts beginning in a
  vowel or in two or more consonants.

!!North Sámi

!Semantic feature system

We postpone this issue until Linda has met with Eckhard in early May.

!!Lule Sámi

TODO:
* add the rest of the inc- words (__Thomas__)
**  everything added that is possible now, about 50 unknown words left+2 abbr.
    +moaddi etc (numerals)
    
!!!8. Name lexicon infrastructure

TODO:
# refactor and prepare risten.no for multiple collections:
##  refactor the code into more and more specific components according to our
    folder hierarchy (__Tomi, Sjur__)
### things are moving forward
# develop the needed XQueries and interface (__Sjur, Tomi__)
##  developing
# data synchronisation between risten.no and the cvs repo (__Tomi__)
##  nothing this week
# test and review when ready

Discussion postponed until Sjur is back.

!!!9. Spellers

Nothing until the new proper noun lexicon is in place. We don't have enough
people to do both.

Discussion postponed until Sjur is back.

!!!10. Other


!!Bug fixing

__50__ open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and __25__ risten.no bugs
