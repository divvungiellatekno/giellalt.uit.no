   and whatever other processes and tasks needed to set up a corpus account.
*** move these issues into Bugzilla (__Sjur__)
* add the new ''Words'' section to the site (__Børre__)
** done



!!!4. Corpus gathering

__NSI:__ the Mac has crashed during the summer, they need a new motherboard for
it, but they don't have money to buy it! This is a major setback for us - the 
major part of Min Áigi and Áššu can't be delivered. Unless... __Børre__ is going
to Kautokeino on a course in the near future, and could probably get the hard
disk mounted on his computer. Discuss and plan this with the NSI guy.

__Bård Eriksen__ has sent the book list. It contains only about 10 titles.

__Lars Kintel__ has contacted us, and offered all his translations to {{smj}}
free of charge. We still need to contact the authours, to get their approval as
well.

__TODO:__
* contact NSI (__Børre__)
** done
* bug __Bård Eriksen__ about the book list (__Børre__)
** done
* continue to contact authors (__Børre__)



!!!5. Corpus infrastructure

!!General

__TODO:__
* consider an article on our corpus framework (__all__)
** put this into Bugzilla (__Trond__)




!!User accounts and access

The whole issue should be moved into Bugzilla as several tasks.

TODO:
* add the issue with subissues to Bugzilla (__Trond__)



!!More texts to the graphical corpus interface:

We are waiting for parallel texts, and aligning parallel text. SD Parliament
meeting memos are excellent for parallell testing, as they are accurately
translated in both directions (but some of the Parliament plenary meeting memos
do not have a nob counterpart, or we haven't got one yet).

__Børre__ has found a lot of old Parliament meeting protocols, and will probably
be able to add missing translations/parallell documents.

TODO:
* align texts, analyse, and send to Lars (__Trond, Saara__)
* add text to the server (__Lars__)


!!Aligner

Discuss NT parallel corpus

originals:  Word, paratext, txt
our format: xml

It boils down to two issues:
# Which original to choose
# Whether to align according to verses or according to our own preprocessor
  (verses) (send both options to the parsers and see which one we like)


Goal: Have the Bible texts in the same format as .

TODO:
* gather parallel texts (__Trond__)
* try out NT alignment strategies (__Saara__)



!!Language recognition

TODO:
* Get more text of the poorly covered languages: {{sma, smj}} (__Trond, Børre__)
** {{sma:}} get the Bible texts (__Trond__)
* improve the {{smj}} LM (__Saara__)
* what about paragraphs with mixed content? Build a corpus of such paragraphs
  (__Trond__)



!!!6. Infrastructure

!!Xerox tools wrapped as servers

No restrictions on IP numbers or domains from which the server is accessed.

Modules to be includes / types of services:
* morphological analyzer
* morph. generator (norm/descr? If !SUB could be added as a regular tag, then we
  can have both)
* hyphenator
* disambiguator
* speller (in the future) - this is not Xerox tools:-)

Supported input formats:
* pure text
* XML according to a fixed DTD - if XML in, always XML out

Output formats:
* text (UTF-8)
* XML (as option) - we need to decide upon the XML delivered (see below)

Access clients:
* Java client (__Tomi__)
* command-line client (__Saara__)
* http access through CGI-script (__Saara__)


XML output format:

{{{
Analyser and disambiguator:
<w form="Tromssan">
<reading lemma="Tromsa" analysis="N+Sg+Loc+.."/>
..
</w>
}}}

Generator and hyphenator should follow the same pattern. __Saara__ will make
something:-)

__TODO:__
* improve and finish the present prototype (__Saara__)



!!Hyphenator

Tros^te^rud TROSTERUD

Čále dahje kopiere sániid lásii, ja deatti "Analysere". Čilgehus giellaoahpalaš

čil^ge^heh^kos ≠
čil^ge^heh^kos ≠
čil^ge^hus     =
čil^ge^hus     =
Čil^ge^hus     <==


TODO:
* improve the clean-up script to remove more-complex word forms (__Saara__)
** done
* Update the sma hyphenator rule set with the insights gained from smj updates
  (__Trond__ during weekends)
* linguistic issues in the hyphenator: (__Sjur__ using M4)
** shortening in compounds (grossly overgenerates in the hyphenator output)
* consider case conversion problems (__Saara__)
* check #- when comparing input string with hyphenated string - the hyphen
  ''could'' be part of the input string, keep it if it is, discard the
  hyphenated string if not (__Saara__)



!!Automatic Bugzilla reminder for untouched bugs

Some perl-libraries needed by Bugzilla weren't in the path, causing it to not
work. Adding them should fix the issue.

TODO:
* fix the remaining issues (__Børre__)



!!M4

__TODO:__
* make speller make targets that utilise M4 to produce normative
  and hyphenation transducers - postponed a while (__Tomi__ or __Sjur__)
* disamb variants for derivations (see next) (__Saara__)
** include make as part of a shell script, which will run the M4 processor on
   the disamb rules (__Saara__)



!!!7. Linguistics

!!Names and multilinguality

We need a more principled approach to this.

Background: the name lexicon is getting attention from the SD name/terminology
sections, and they would like to use our name lexicon also for public searching.

Observations:

1) Multilinguality is always optional.

2) We can observe that "foreign" names in texts follows a domination pattern:
majority language forms can be found in minority language texts as real names
("Kautokeino produkter"), whereas minority language names ''almost always''
occur in majority language texts as citations. And citations should not be
considered a natural part of the text.

3) When looking at our name classification, multilinguality varies according to:

{{{
Ani - weak/none? (pet, myth anim.  names)
Fem - weak (informative)
Mal - weak (informative)
Obj - strong
Org - strong
Plc - strong for the national and country names, weak (informative) for foreign
       names
Sur - none
Tit - strong (titles)
}}}

Suggestion:

We need to reconsider the ''all names in all languages'' policy. That policy is
valid only for {{Fem, Mal,}} and {{Sur}} (and Ani and Tit?). For
{{Obj, Org, Plc}} the rule should be that if they have multilingual names, each
name should only be used in it's own language. Then we need a modification
saying that majority language names can be included in minority language
lexicons __if attested__ in our corpus. Also, the majority language varies
according to country (obviously), which means that in a speller context, we
might consider tailoring spellers for each country, leaving out noise relating
to majority language names from another country.

A further issue is whether we should reconsider our cohort policy. Today, Sur
and Plc are __different__ readings. An alternative would be to have them as
secondary tags, not in conflict with each other:

{{{
"<Trosterud>"
        "Trosterud" N Prop Sur Sg Nom <<< @HNOUN
        "Trosterud" N Prop Plc Sg Nom <<< @HNOUN
"<Trosterud>"
        "Trosterud" N Prop Sg Nom <Sur> <Plc> <<< @HNOUN
"<Trosterud>"
        "Trosterud" N Prop Sg Nom &Sur &Plc <<< @HNOUN
}}}


!!Derivation and spellers like Aspell

* enclose the CG rule that preferres lexicalised forms over derivations in M4
  (__Saara__)
* find and study all derived verbs in our corpus (__Thomas__)
* suggest which derivations could be generated (__Thomas__)
* lexicalise the rest (__Thomas__)



!!North Sámi

Nothing this week?

!!Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine smj proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (__Thomas, Trond__)
** done some more, much more left
* hire new linguist (__Sjur__)
** nothing real, but one new candidate has surfaced



!!Komi

It appears that the conversion form LexC to XML went wrong wrt to upper:lower
pairs, consider the following entry from the Attic (noun file):

{{{
вос:воск N ;
}}}

The corresponding XML is:
{{{
<entry>
  <lemma>воск</lemma>
  <stem/>
  <contlex>Noun1</contlex>
  <POS>N</POS>
  <article>
    <ENG></ENG>
    <FIN></FIN>
    <CF></CF>
  </article>
</entry>
}}}

It should have been:
{{{
  <lemma>вос</lemma>
  <stem>воск</stem>
}}}

There seems to be an issue. Trond will look into it.

On Victorio:
{{{
/usr/local/cvs/repository/kt/kom/src/Attic/
~$ll /usr/local/cvs/repository/kt/kom/script/kom-utf.xml,v 
}}}

TODO:
* check the dictionary and lexc source files



!!!8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decided in Tromsø:
* add logging facilities to the interface
* add option to download local copies of the lexicon files directly from the db
* batch editing (change all entries in the found set), should later be enhanced
  to allow selection of exceptions (the found set minus deselected items)
* tag for excluding/including a name from certain applications
* future epxansion: choose what info to display in the single language browser
* display existing language entries when adding a new language to a record
* add editor to change single, existing entries


Details can be found in [the meeting
memo.|/doc/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

TODO:
* finish refactoring for multiple collections in the search interfarce
  (__Sjur__)
** done - see [http://88.114.127.52:8080/exist/risten/]
   Search for: Tte or во
* develop the needed XQueries and UI (__Sjur, Tomi__)
* turn Tomcat on on the G5; send admin username and password to __Sjur__
  (__Børre__)
* add eXist and the proper noun interface to the G5 (__Sjur__)

Postponed:
* data synchronisation between risten.no and the cvs repo
* new version of xml2lexc (based on ccat), should handle complex names correct:
  construct entries like we have now from the different parts of a complex name
  entry


!!!9. Spellers

!!Speller data generation

__TODO:__
* start to plan the implementation of the speller data conversion/generation
  (__Tomi__)
** done, progressing fine.



!!!10. Other

!!Meeting with the map authorities

__Sjur__ is going to a meeting in Oslo on Wednesday, meeting with the
Ministeries and the __Statens kartverk__.

Issues:
* open source vs money


!!Bug fixing

__64__ open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and __25__ risten.no bugs

Guess: 1/3 of the bugs are fixed already (?)


!!Meetings and Marratech

__Børre__ talked to __Leif Åge__ about the Marratech server. All users need to
be inside the SD firewall. Thus, Marratech is __not__ an option.

Quoting Marratech:

[Marratech on proxies and
firewalls|http://www.marratech.com/userman/manager/app_firewalls.html]

What about using proxies for __Maaren?__
iChat has a setup page for it in Preferences->Accounts. Børre will investigate

__TODO:__
* investigate use of proxies for __Maaren__ (__Børre__)


!!Task lists as iCal entries

TODO:
* update Maaren's installation to r430284 (__Børre__)

!!Words section

You all need to check out CVS/words, and link to the relevant place, cf how
gt/doc/ is linked.

!!!11. Next meeting, closing

Next meeting 16.10.2006 at 9:30.

__Saara__ will work offline next week, and won't be present in the meeting.
