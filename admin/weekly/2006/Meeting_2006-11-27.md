# 3. Documentation

There's a problem with the reliability of the Jetty (`forrest run`) version of
our site. Thus, still using the static version on our main/public site.

TODO:
* update all forrest installations, including local patches (**Børre**)
    - created a tailored forrest distribution to download and install
* port all i18n work to the main branch (from the i18n branch) (**Børre**)
    - done

# 4. Corpus gathering

We finally received the Áššu and Min Áigi files from 1995 to 2001. Many of the
Áššu files are in Quark Express and WriteNow. Quark files should be readable by
InDesign (which we have), and WriteNow files should be readable by many Mac
applications. All files can be expected to be encoded in MacSámi.

No newer files received from Áššu, **Børre** should contact them again.

To be able to convert WriteNow files (WriteNow is a long dead MacOS Classic application), we need the
commercial software package [MacLinkPlus
| http://www.dataviz.com/products/maclinkplus/index.html] from [DataViz
| http://www.dataviz.com/]. It should be available from MacOffice in Tromsø, or
can be bought online from their home page (USD 79.99).

More South Sámi files are forthcoming soon.

**TODO:**
* get `sma` Bible / NT texts (**Trond**)
    - not done due to illness
* Discussions with the Sámi Parliament about `sma` (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* send the filename renaming script to NSI; get their corpus (**Børre**)
    - done
* ask SD/Sig-Britt Persson about some of the South Sámi bible texts (**Sjur**)
    - not done

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## More texts to the graphical corpus interface:

**Lars** suggested changes (<p> only policy) to the corpus DTD (in news). Good
suggestions, but we will consider waiting till next year (and new project money)
to see whether we'll follow through.

TODO:
* Consider whether to implement the <p> only policy or not (**Saara**)
* add text to the server (**Lars**)
* Discuss with Lars (**Trond**)

## Aligner

The latest cvs version of our copy of the Aligner can be run from the command
line, thanks to work by **Børre**:

The exact instructions on how to compile and run the program is in the README.txt file. Basic usage as follows:

```
tca2 -a anchorfile samifile otherlangfile
```

**TODO:**
* gather more parallel texts (**Trond**)
* re-analyze parallel files using the command-line version (**Saara**)
* make a runnable version available on both the g5 and victorio (**Børre**)
    - Done

## Language recognition

TODO:

* get more `sma` texts, first the Bible / NT (**Trond**)

# 6. Infrastructure

## Xerox tools wrapped as servers

The PLX format for clitics have been checked with Polderland, and we should be
able to do fine without them. Thus, we generate all paradigms **without**
clitics.

**TODO:**
* finalise the paradigm generator (requires paradigm grammar) (**Saara**)
    - done, except needs to remove the clitics
* fix the corpus tag list in the `cwb/` directory (**Trond**)
    - The list now matches the actual tags.
* create / check the paradigm grammar as exemplified above (**Thomas**)
    - done
* update the generating transducer to only be normative, and without the
  subclass tags (**Sjur**)
    - done
* discuss clitics in PLX format with Polderland (**Sjur**)
    - done

## Hyphenator

The list of unrecognised words is found in victorio in `/tmp/hyph-errors.txt`,
whereas words to check can be found in the same location in the file
`maaren-liste.txt.gz`.

Typical problem words/reports (in `hyph-errors.txt`) are:
```
No forms for šveicalažžanat
No forms for šveicalažžaneamet
No forms for šveicalažžaneame
No forms for šveicalažžanan
No forms for šveicalažžanis
No forms for šveicalažžaneaset
....
```

TODO:
* make new list of unrecognised forms (**Sjur**)
    - done
* investigate unrecognised word forms (**Maaren, Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
    - not done

# 7. Linguistics

## Names and multilinguality

TODO:
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
    1. working on it
1. add @type=secondary and @excl=speller,hyph to all names marked with !SUB
  (**Saara**)
    1. done
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Derivation and spellers like Aspell

TODO:
* redo the work for `smj`, including discussion regarding *Actio*
  (**Thomas, Sjur, Trond**)
    - Thomas is working on it.

## North Sámi

The following words are included in the normative list despite being marked
with !SUB:

```
accompagnerejun
ábuhuvvože
ábuhuvvože      ábuhit+V+TV+Pass+Pot+Prs+Du1
áccohallagođežedne
```

TODO:
* investigate the generated word form list sent to Polderland - use the command
  `make wordlist TARGET=sme` in *victorio* (**Maaren**, **Thomas**)
* check why some SUB-marked entries got included in the normative transducer
  (**Thomas, Sjur**)

## Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* hire new linguist (**Sjur**)
    - new suggestion in the meeting

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decided in Tromsø:
* add logging facilities to the interface
* add option to download local copies of the lexicon files directly from the db
* batch editing (change all entries in the found set), should later be enhanced
  to allow selection of exceptions (the found set minus deselected items)
* tag for excluding/including a name from certain applications
* future epxansion: choose what info to display in the single language browser
* display existing language entries when adding a new language to a record
* add editor to change single, existing entries

Details can be found in [the meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

TODO:
* develop the needed XQueries and UI (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add a simple password protection to risten.no in the G5 (**Børre**)

Postponed:
* data synchronisation between risten.no and the cvs repo
* new version of xml2lexc (based on ccat), should handle complex names correct:
  construct entries like we have now from the different parts of a complex name
  entry

# 9. Spellers

## Polderland data generation

All nouns are now generated in PLX, not yet the other POSes. Also the closed
POSes will be generated the same way, which means we need paradigm grammars for
them as well. In the simplest case that is just one feature/tag combination.

Also, there might be possible to ask `lookup` to print out the whole paradigm.
This should be investigate.

We need to close the compound specification discussion. We'll have a meeting for
it later in the week with **Thomas, Trond and Sjur**.

**TODO:**
* write paradigm grammar for the closed POSes (**Thomas**)
* check whether `lookup` can be used to generate paradigms for closed POSes
  (**Sjur**)
* decide how to specify compounding behaviour info for the lexicon
  (**Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
    - meeting Tuesday at 12.30
* update the hyphenation filter to always return one - if there are multiple
  alternatives after all the other filtering, pick the one with the most
  hyphenation points (**Saara**)
    - done
* make PLX lexicon for all open POSes (**Tomi**)
* add derivations to the PLX generation (**Tomi**)
* add compound stems to the PLX generation (**Tomi**)
* add closed POS and clitics to PLX generation (**Tomi**)

## Aspell

In preparation for the Aspell work, **Børre** has sent an e-mail to the Aspell
developer e-mail list. Here is the most interesting part of the thread:

```
> What features in hunspell would you specifically like to have in aspell?

Possibly:

- Max. 65535 affix classes and twofold affix stripping

- Handling conditional affixes, circumfixes, fogemorphemes, forbidden
   words, pseudoroots and homonyms.

- Support complex compoundings

I believe some of these will benefit you.

However I only want to implement them if these is a clear benefit to it.
For example based on what several people have told be complex compounding
rules are not worth it.

Aspell is far more complex then Myspell and each feature needs to
implemented carefully so that it will behave sensibly with the
suggestion code.  Also it is important that the addition of the
feature won't degrade performance, Especially when the feature isn't used.
```

The whole thread is available [here
| http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/aspell-devel/2006-11/msg00031.html].

TODO when the major part of the PLX conversion is done:
* add Aspell/Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study Hunspell, perhaps also Soikko (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)

## Testing

When the PLX-based speller is ready: use the generated word list as test input:
all should be accepted (coverage self-testing). Pick random 1% and randomly
change them with edit distance 1, run through speller = testing false positives

We need a meeting to plan testing. We'll do it shortly this week, and perhaps
a longer meeting in Alta.

**TODO:**
* meeting Wednesday at 9.30 (**Sjur, Børre**)
* consider a script (shell+AppleScript?) for automatic testing of MS Word
  (**Sjur, Børre**)
* get an Intel Mac for testing Windows spellers; get a WinXP license from SD
  (**Børre, Sjur**)

# 10. Other

## Corpus contracts

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra on NoDaLi-sta (**Sjur**)

## Bug fixing

**57** open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and **24** risten.no bugs

Guess: 1/3 of the bugs are fixed already (?)

## Task lists as iCal entries

TODO:
* update Maaren's Forrest installation to r430284 (**Børre**)

## Employee seminar in Alta

TODO:
* send in hotel room list (**Divvun**)
    - done (all)

# 11. Next meeting, closing
