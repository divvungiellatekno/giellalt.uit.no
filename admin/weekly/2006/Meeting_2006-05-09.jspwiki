!!!3. Documentation

TODO:
* documentation on how to apply for a user account for the corpus repo
  (__Børre__)
**  The item will be moved to the TODO list, again.

!!!4. Corpus gathering

__Trond__ added __sme__ beuraucratic texts, roughly 0,4 mill words, total size
now approaching 1,5 mill words.

!! Trip to Sámi municipalities

__Børre__ back from his trip.

* Min  Áigi
** 3-4 years of texts ready, both uncorrected and corrected (with bullet)
* Sámi parliament
* Tana
* Isak Saba guovddáš (Nesseby, talked with Signe Iversen)
* Utsjoki (a lot of admin texts)
** pdf files as free texts
** orig MS Word files require a closed contract (and a Finnish language version
   of the contract)
* Sámi ráđđi (Utsjoki)
* Inari (Sámi parliament)
** got four texts, will ask for more
* Giellagas instituhtta (Oulu, talked with Seija Risten Somby)

The Isak Saba guovddaš will not sign unless the contract is in Sámi, and they
are sceptical to giving texts to the project for free. Maaren (and Trond)
translated the A contract to Sámi yesterday.

Note to be placed somewhere:

[http://www.oqaasileriffik.gl/dk/ Greenland's language secretariat] have a 
paradigm generator based upon Xerox tools, we should ask for their source code.
(site in Greeenlandic, English and Danish).

The Min Áigi format should be dealt with: \@ingress etc should be dealt with for
the .txt, but business as usal for the .doc files. We should have \@code as 
paragraphs, look at the rest. __Trond__ to look at the format.

!!Collecting

See a [previous meeting memo|Meeting_2006-01-16] for what's to be done.

TODO: Send out the rest of the letters (__Børre__)

Signed contracts since last meeting:
* NSI (=> a lot of Min Áigi and Áššu texts)
* Seija Risten Somby, giving her gradu-paper.

!!Odin

__Sæth__ replied by e-mail, hasn't had time to follow-up, but will try to
include us in their plans.

* __Børre__ will weekly mirror the URL mentioned in Sæths e-mail, 
  and add missing files to the corpus.
  
!!Olavi Korhonen's Lule Sámi dictionary.

* No news this week

TODO: __Børre__ to contact Olavi Korhonen and Kuhmunen

!! KIO Grafisk and the Iđut books

__TODO__:
* send letters to the authors (__Børre__)
* wait for the discussions with Davvi Girji
**  A talk with Brita Kåven, revealed that they would have a look at
    the contracts __after__ easter.

!!Bible texts

We will get text from Finland, but still haven't received any. We have got the
Swedish text from Sweden. As for the last html versions from Norway, __Trond__
has not contacted them last week. 

Swedish html has arrived, no paratext. Norsk bibelselskap has not sent 
corrected New Testament versions for sme, and not paratext for nno/nob.

TODO:
* convert smj NT to paratext (__Børre__)
* get fin, swe, nob and nno NT and OT in __paratext__ format. (__Trond__)

!!Min Áigi

__Børre__ has received texts, and forwarded them to __Trond__. Problems with
Unicode in the filenames, as the non-ASCII characters are unparsed strings with
the octal code of the character(s) in question:

The files (appr 2000 files) are added, here:
/usr/local/share/corp/orig/sme/news/MinAigi/

We have problems with Unicode characters in filenames. All characters with
diacritics are stored decomposed on MacOS X, and when transferring the files to
Linux (cochise) via a tar file, the characters are not recomposed, making the
files accessible only by typing the combining diacritic - not nice. We also now
have the same problem on Mac, making it in practice impossible to access a set
of files like:

{{{
a84-231-8-254:~ sjur$ l a+TAB
áda  áde  ádo  åde  
a84-231-8-254:~ sjur$ l a
}}}

This was solved once before, and we need to look at this again. The old Bugzilla
issue should be reopened. The bug was reopened: 
http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=76

__TODO__:
* __Børre__ to contact __Per Christian Biti__ on technical issues (how to
  transfer texts).
* reopen Bugzilla issue, and study the previous discussion and solution
  regarding Unicode characters in filenames (__Saara__)
* add filename extensions to files not having one
* investigate whether the bullet has a meaning or could be removed
* Space in file names should be changed to underscore (and not to hyphen!).


Min Áigi seems to have been changing from text files to MS Word around issue
015-05.

!!Kåfjord

Promised to send us texts, but nothing has arrived yet.

__TODO__: __Børre__ to contact them.

!!Sámi Instituhtta

Audhild Schanche has signed the contract. We will have to contact them about
transferring the texts. 

__TODO__: __Børre__ to contact them.

!!!5. Corpus infrastructure

https://giellalt.uit.no/lang/corp/corpus-summary.html

TODO:

!!Changes and updates because of the Divvun public tender

User account admin and infra: see [previous
  memo|/doc/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-06.html].

TODO: see above under ''Documentation.''

Automatic build of the content of our corpus repo: also see [previous
  memo|/doc/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-06.html].

TODO:
* make free texts available
** done weekly by a cron script (but only if there are new files) (__Saara__)
*** move to bugzilla
* Make a link, easily available, to these texts.
** done as a downloadable tar package.

Name change again?
{{{
gt -> gtbound/
gtbound -> some nifty new letter... ?
gtfree -> some nifty new letter... ?
}}}
__ Trond__ to come up with some new suggestion.

!!Free and non-free texts

More info in a [previous meeting
memo.|/doc/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-13.html]

TODO:
* Check the status of the texts, again. (__Børre, Trond, Saara__)
* Rerun the conversion afterwards (__Saara__ is the one with the magic spell)
* check against bugs
  [273|http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=273] and 
  [272|http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=272]

!!More texts to the graphical corpus interface:

TODO:
* We would like to have more than the NT in the graphical interface
 http://omilia.uio.no/CE/sami/ (__Saara__)
** We add the largest texts first.
* We would like to have grammatical searchability, not only POS. (__Saara__,
  __Trond__)
* This presupposes a discussion with Oslo. (__Trond__ and __Saara__ to continue
  this discussion)
* For Lule Sámi: We would like to have a parallel corpus interface with NT
  (text only). This presupposes better quality texts (__Trond, Børre__)
** Better Lule NT text still not made.
* The list of good candicates: The longest (admin) texts.
** We need a ccat version of the script for analysing text, still keeping xml
   tags (__Tomi__).

Top-two priorities:
# Trond and Saara to discuss with Lars.
# Lars to add text to the server.
# Tomi to prepare for the parallel corpus.

!!Language recognition

TODO:
* refine language recognition (__Saara__)
** in progress
* create a short word list to help the trigram heuristics
** Trond has made such lists for all lgs except sme, smj and nob.
* send Saara sme, smj and nob files (sort, but not uniq -c) (__Trond__)
* Add some flag to write into the xsl file (__Saara__):
** method:do not run lg recognition
** method:Choose between these 2:nob, sme

!!!6. Infrastructure

!!Aligner

Today, we have two anchor files in addition to the original one. 

TODO:
* Read documentation and try out, give feedback to Bergen. (__Trond__,
  __Saara__, __Tomi__)
* conflate nno with nob into 'nor' (__Trond__, letters a, b, c done)
**  Partly done, must go through and see.
* __Saara__ to install the aligner, everyone to read the documentation
** done, waiting for the test files from Bergen.
* __Trond__ and __Saara__ will continue this issue.

!!Hyphenator

Trond and Thomas have been updating the propernoun file with ^ tags. We need the
tag in front of compound parts beginning in a vowel or in two or more
consonants. Compound parts beginning with one consonant are handled correctly.

TODO:
* Remove the ^ signs from the UPPER level when generating (just like the TV and
  IV tags are removed today) (__Trond__)
** done
* correct the treatment of hyphenation of word boundaries and exceptions (fst
  gymnastics) (__Sjur, Trond__)
** Still not done.  
* add a possibility to upload whole documents for hyphenation (and also
  analysis, generation, etc) (__Saara__)
* we should log all and every word/text uploaded/hyphenated/analyzed etc
** we'll do it, but it does not have first priority (__Saara__)
* add exceptions marks to the {{smj}} lexicon (boks^távva)

!!!7. Linguistics

!!General - hyphenation

See discussion, open questions and decission in the [previous meeting
memo.|/doc/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-04-03.html]

TODO:
* add all word boundaries (__Thomas__)
**  Done
* Set up the mechanism for the hash transducer package - fst gymnastics, see
  above.
* Lule Sámi behaviour around -st- is still somewhat unclear. Trond has had a
  discussion with Anders Kintel and Thomas, it should continue.

!!North Sámi

There are some heavy bugs:
* he(a)ddjiid is one
* compounding cleanup - no shortening when normative, still shortening when
  analysing corpus texts?
* vowel-shortening when compounding (we need the input from Pekka!)

We should have some linguistic workshops while Maaren is here.

!!Lule Sámi

TODO:
* add the rest of the inc- words (__Thomas__)
** everything added that is possible now, about 50 unknown words left+2 abbr.

* There are some open issues in the marginal area of the smj transducer:
** numerals, e.g. These become more visible as we get real texts.    
** names
** compounds? Shortening here as well, but not in written language (some
   lexicalised exceptions, as in sme)
** loanwords?

!!!8. Name lexicon infrastructure

TODO:
# refactor and prepare risten.no for multiple collections:
##  refactor the code into more and more specific components according to our

!!!9. Spellers

Nothing until the new proper noun lexicon is in place. We don't have enough
people to do both. Here's our most important targets for spellers in the near
future:

* aspell
* hunspell


!!!10. Public tender

TODO:
* read the offers (__Børre, Sjur, Trond, Tomi__)
* meet on Tuesday 13 to sum up the findings (__Børre, Sjur, Tomi, Trond__)

!!!11. Other

!!Bug fixing

__50__ open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and __25__ risten.no bugs

Please help Saara with bug 279. Not much help...
Saara will contact Roy on this issue.

After the corpus issues have been somewhat settled, we should do a bug
barnraising. ... and then a new one after the name lexicon is fixed.
