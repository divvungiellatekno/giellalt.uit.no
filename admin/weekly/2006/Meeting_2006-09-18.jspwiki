# 3. Documentation

TODO:
* finish i18n work by adding a list of available language versions to each
  document (**Børre** with help from **Sjur**)
    - Sjur has done quite a lot, but is not finished
* make pdf set-up work on victorio (**Børre**)
    - working on victorio (and thus on the external site), but it does not work
   together with our present i18n efforts:-( To be continued...
* Write both user and admin documentation (**Børre**, review: **Sjur, Thomas**)
    - User documentation probably in several languages. This covers how to apply
   for an account, on what grounds one can apply, and pointers to documentation
   telling how to use the corpus.
    - Admin documentation, telling how we set the permissions to the corpus files,
   and whatever other processes and tasks needed to set up a corpus account.

# 4. Corpus gathering

**Børre** will focus on the gathering this week, we need more material...

**TODO:**
* contact NSI (**Børre**)
* contact authors (**Børre**, eventually **Lene**)
* evalutate an agreement with **Bård Eriksen** helping us collecting `smj`
  texts (**Børre** and **Sjur**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## General

Our way of dealing with the conversion of input documents has now reached an
advanced level. At some point we might consider publish our results, to the
benefit of the rest of the research community.

**TODO:**
* remove headers and footers in the PDF conversion (**Saara**)
    - done something, see JPedal below
* fix Min Áigi filenames (**Saara**)
    - done
* Go through the java issues of JPedal (**Saara, Tomi**)
    - soon ready?

## User accounts and access

For details, see a [previous meeting memo](Meeting_2006-06-19), as well as the
memo from a [dedicated
meeting|/infra/corpus_policy.html].

### Shell access

TODO:
* export to `/opt` (with cron) tools that the project team members find in 
  their cvs tree (the bound users do not have a cvs tree, and therefore need 
  these tools in `/opt` in order to conduct linguistic analyses) (**Tomi**)
    - Decision:
        - compiled transducers to `/opt` also in the future
        - scripts etc to `/usr/local/share/bin/`
* make shell script wrappers for the most common commands for user friendliness
  (we must think of what commands they are) (**Trond**)
    - (first version of first script, teaksta.sh, was checked in, but it is still
   not working (the problem is a simple handling of input-output, some shell
   script literates should have a look at it)
* write user account form, probably ask for copy of existing ones from the IT
  centre (**Trond** and **Sjur**)
* possibly deploy the user account form as an HTML form (**Børre**)
* write documentation for our `bound` users, with pointers to the ordinary 
  documentation (**Børre, Trond**)
* write documentation for how to apply for a user account (where's the form, to
  whom do I send the form, who needs it, etc.) (**Børre**)
* make our own guidelines for the user application processing (**Børre**)
* make a test user (**Børre**)
* test corpus access as test user (**Trond**)

### Web browser access

TODO:
* discuss with Oslo (**Trond**)
* delay other tasks until we are ready to go public?
* user management for access to bound texts
* short user guide needed before going public (either write one or take whatever
  has been made in Oslo (**Trond**)

## More texts to the graphical corpus interface:

TODO:
* add text to the server (**Lars**)

## Aligner

TODO:
* use the present aligner to generate some initial input for Oslo to test
  (**Trond** and **Saara**)

## Language recognition

TODO:
* Get more text of the poorly covered languages: `sma, smj` (**Trond, Børre**)
    - `sma:` get the Bible texts (**Trond**)
* study the paragraphs of 20 or less characters, where the errors will be
  (**Trond**)
* study the mistakes our recogniser makes today (**Trond**)
* what about paragraphs with mixed content? Build a corpus of such paragraphs
  (**Trond**)

# 6. Infrastructure

## Xerox tools wrapped as servers

Saara has made a prototype, available as server_anl.pl (the server) and
client_anl.pl (for a client session). It still needs more development, but can
be tested.

The server communicates purely over TCP/IP, which means that in principle any
client can talk to it.

Very brief user instructions:

In one window: `server_anl.pl`. In another window: `client_anl.pl -p`.
Type "quit" to exit the client and server.

**TODO:**
* improve and finish the present prototype (**Saara**)
* feature request: option for XML output from server

## Hyphenator

First hyphenating transducer was made last week, but it produces wrong output
because of overgeneration on the generator side.

*gahpira* => gah-pi-ra **and** ga-hpir, should be only the first one.

```
                         ´  hyphentated output
|     |
|   hyphenation rules
                        /     |
filter.fst & hyph.fst <-    generator <-------- overgeneration:
                        \     | ----------baseform/analysis
|   analyser
|     |
                         `  input
```

We need a "filter" fst: `a-z... -:0 -:- ^:0 #:0`

Sketch:
```
[%-, ^, %# ] (<-) 0 ;
```
and the rest by default: a = a:a.

TODO:
* correct the treatment of hyphenation of word boundaries and exceptions (fst
  gymnastics) (**Sjur, Trond**)
    - done (by **Tomi** and **Sjur**), needs improvement because of overgeneration
   problem
* implement the 'filter.fst' above (**Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)
* Update the sma hyphenator rule set with the insights gained from smj updates
  (**Trond** during weekends)

## Automatic Bugzilla reminder for untouched bugs

TODO:
* give mail reminders a second try; ask Thor-Øivind for help if needed
  (**Børre**)

## M4

**TODO:**
* make speller and hyphenator make targets that utilise M4 to produce normative
  and hyphenation transducers; also disamb variants (see next) (**Tomi**)
    - done for hyphenation (Sjur and Tomi)

# 7. Linguistics

## Derivation and spellers like Aspell

* add an option to `lookup2cg` to keep `+Der/` tags (**Saara**)
    - doesn't seem to remove any tags at all (or very few if at all)
* revert the CG rule that preferres lexicalised forms over derivations with M4
  (**Trond** to write M4 pseudocode, **M4-literates** to translate).
  In the beginning of sme-dis.rle there is an explanation of the pseudocode.
  Just search for the rules as explained there.
* find and study all derived verbs in our corpus (**Thomas**)
* suggest which derivations could be generated (**Thomas**)
* lexicalise the rest (**Thomas**)

## Semantic double-tagging of names

TODO:
* move the existing guidelines to a separate document (**Børre**)
    - done (by **Sjur**)
* make sure all linguists are aware of the guidelines (**Trond, Sjur**)
* write disamb rules to implement the system above (**Trond, Linda**)

## North Sámi

**TODO:**
* check all XXX cases (**Thomas, Lene**)
    - done
* consider checking all verbs for non-verbs (**Thomas, Lene**)
    - Thomas talked with Lene, this is not necessary, Lenes "non-words" were all
   marked !SUB. Thomas has recently checked all verbs.

## Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine smj proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decided in Tromsø:
* add logging facilities to the interface
* add option to download local copies of the lexicon files directly from the db
* batch editing (change all entries in the found set), should later be enhanced
  to allow selection of exceptions (the found set minus deselected items)
* tag for excluding/including a name from certain applications
* future epxansion: choose what info to display in the single language browser
* display existing language entries when adding a new language to a record
* add editor to change single, existing entries

Details can be found in [the meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

TODO:
* finish refactoring for multiple collections in the search interfarce
  (**Sjur**)
* develop the needed XQueries and UI (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* data synchronisation between risten.no and the cvs repo (**Tomi**)
    - discussion started on eXist-list, nothing useful came up. We need to
   reformulate the question from our perspective, and bring it up again
   (**Sjur**)
* add eXist and the proper noun interface to the G5 using Tomcat
  (**Sjur and Børre**)

# 9. Tromsø meeting follow-up

TODO:
* speller development - see the [meeting
  memo|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-lexc2xspell.html]. Separate
  follow-up next week.
* Lule Sámi linguist (**Sjur**)

# 10. Other

## Bug fixing

**64** open Divvun/Disamb bugs (two down!), and **25** risten.no bugs

Guess: 1/3 of the bugs are fixed already (?)

## Meetings and Marratech

**TODO:**
* download and install newest Marratech
  (**Maaren**)
* we need instructions on how to use it, and test it (**Sjur**)

## Task lists as iCal entries

TODO:
* update Maaren's and Saara's installations to r430284 (**Børre**)

# 11. Next meeting, closing

Next meeting 25.9.2006 at 9:30.

Closed at 11:03.
