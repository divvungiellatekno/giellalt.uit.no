# 3. Documentation

TODO:
* documentation on how to apply for a user account for the corpus repo
  (**Børre**)
    -  The item will be moved to Bugzilla

# 4. Corpus gathering

## Collecting

See a [previous meeting memo](Meeting_2006-01-16) for what's to be done.

TODO: Send out the rest of the letters (**Børre**)

New contacts:
* Elle Márjá Vars (sme, 38 titles in Bibsys, novels, plays, both iđut and Davvi 
  Girji, one translated into smj and sma, several into nob)

## Odin

* **Børre** will set up a weekly cron job to mirror the URL mentioned in Sæths
  e-mail, and add missing files to the corpus.

  
## Olavi Korhonen's Lule Sámi dictionary.

* No news this week

TODO: **Børre** to contact Olavi Korhonen and Kuhmunen

## KIO Grafisk and the Iđut books

**TODO**:
* send letters to the authors (**Børre**)
    - one contacted, the rest this week

## Bible texts

We will get text from Finland, but still haven't received any. We have got the
Swedish text from Sweden. As for the last html versions from Norway, **Trond**
has not contacted them last week. 

Swedish html has arrived, no paratext. Norsk bibelselskap has not sent 
corrected New Testament versions for sme, and not paratext for nno/nob.

TODO:
* convert smj NT to paratext (**Børre**)
* get fin, swe, nob and nno NT and OT in **paratext** format. (**Trond**)

## Davvi Girji

A talk with Brita Kåven, revealed that they would have a look at
the contracts **after** easter. Has been away, **Børre** will call her again
today.

## Min Áigi

Agreement: they will send us updates each month. Standard license.

We have problems with Unicode characters in filenames. This was solved once
before, and we need to look at this again. The old Bugzilla
issue should be reopened. The bug was reopened: 
http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=76

The Min Áigi format should be dealt with: \@ingress etc should be dealt with for
the .txt, but business as usal for the .doc files. 

Done so far: Trond and Saara? Trond made a list of tags, and Saara  will make
the xsl conversion routine for the typographic tags.

Saara is implementing the tag format.

**TODO**:
* reopen Bugzilla issue, and study the previous discussion and solution
  regarding Unicode characters in filenames (**Saara**)
    - done
* add filename extensions to files not having one
    - done
* Space in file names should be changed to underscore (and not to hyphen!).
    - done
* send bug report to Apple (typing filenames in Terminal does not match, moving
  filenames across plattforms via tarballs creates problems - the names are not
  the same!) (**Sjur**)
* make xsl conversion routine for the typographic tags (**Saara**)

## Kåfjord

Promised to send us texts. Some texts have arrived, but nothing from Ája.

**TODO**: **Børre** will contact them.

## Sámi Instituhtta

Børre contacted Richard Valkeapää, the IT-consult at NSI. He put it on his
todo list, as he would have to contact the person who has worked with the 
newspaper texts anyway. He said this would be done in the near future (within
a month).

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

https://giellalt.uit.no/lang/corp/corpus-summary.html

TODO:

## Changes and updates because of the Divvun public tender

User account admin and infra: see [previous
  memo|/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-06.html].

TODO: see above under *Documentation.*

Automatic build of the content of our corpus repo: also see [previous
  memo|/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-06.html].

TODO:
* make free texts available
    - done weekly by a cron script (but only if there are new files) (**Saara**)
        - move to bugzilla: done
* Make a link, easily available, to these texts.
    - done as a downloadable tar package.

Name change again? **Trond** has come up with some new suggestion:

```
gt -> gtbound/
gtbound -> bound/
gtfree -> free/
```

NB! keep symlinks from the old names to the new names for now.

## Free and non-free texts

More info in a [previous meeting
memo.|/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-13.html]

TODO:
* Check the status of the texts, again. (**Børre, Trond, Saara**)
* Rerun the conversion afterwards (**Saara** is the one with the magic spell)
* check against bugs
  [273](http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=273) and 
  [272](http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=272)
    - these are now fixed.
* update the script(s) to only copy texts to the free/ dir which are explicitly
  marked as free (**Saara**)

## More texts to the graphical corpus interface:

TODO:
* We would like to have more than the NT in 
  [the graphical interface](http://omilia.uio.no/CE/sami/) (**Saara**)
    - We add the largest texts first.
* We would like to have grammatical searchability, not only POS. (**Saara**,
  **Trond**  This presupposes a discussion with Oslo. (**Trond** and **Saara** 
  to continue this discussion)
* For Lule Sámi: We would like to have a parallel corpus interface with NT
  (text only). This presupposes better quality texts (**Trond, Børre**)
    - Better Lule NT text still not made.
* The list of good candicates: The longest (admin) texts.
    - We need a new option in ccat for analysing text while still keeping the
   xml tags and structure (**Tomi**)
    - xml texts number <p>, preprocess finds <.> <?> <!> and ccat numbers them as
   <s>.
    - Then the aligner aligns...

Top-two priorities:
1. Trond to discuss more with Lars on tag unification, and unify them.
1. Tomi to change ccat to be able to create the right input for the corpus
  analysis.
1. Lars to add text to the server.

## Language recognition

TODO:
* refine language recognition (**Saara**)
    - in progress, continue discussion in
    [249](http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=249)
* create a short word list to help the trigram heuristics
    - Trond has made such lists for all lgs except smj.
* send **Saara** smj files (**Trond**)
* Add some flag to write into the xsl file (**Saara**):
    - method:do not run lg recognition
    - method:Choose between these 2: nob, sme, etc.

# 6. Infrastructure

## Paradigm generation

[Greenland's language secretariat](http://www.oqaasileriffik.gl/dk/) has a
paradigm generator based upon Xerox tools, we have asked for their source code,
and will get it (site in Greeenlandic, English and Danish).

Try e.g. illu "house", aput "snow" (or any word in st/kal/src/noun-kal-lex.txt)

TODO:
* Put **Saara** and **Tero** in contact with each other (**Trond**)
* The paradigm generator should also have an xml-out option (for use in e.g.
  electronic dictionaries) - on hold till we know more about the generator

## Aligner

TODO:
* Read documentation and try out, give feedback to Bergen. (**Trond**,
  **Saara**)
* **Saara** to install the aligner, everyone to read the documentation
    - done, waiting for the test files from Bergen.
* **Trond** and **Saara** will continue this issue.

## Hyphenator

**Trond** and **Thomas** have been updating the propernoun file with ^ tags. We
need the tag in front of compound parts beginning in a vowel or in two or more
consonants. Compound parts beginning with one consonant are handled correctly.

TODO:
* correct the treatment of hyphenation of word boundaries and exceptions (fst
  gymnastics) (**Sjur, Trond**)
    - Still not done.  
* add a possibility to upload whole documents for hyphenation (and also
  analysis, generation, etc) (**Saara**)
    - moved to Bugzilla
* we should log all and every word/text uploaded/hyphenated/analyzed etc
    - we'll do it, but it does not have first priority (**Saara**)
        - moved to Bugzilla

# 7. Linguistics

## General - hyphenation

See discussion, open questions and decission in the [previous meeting
memo.|/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-04-03.html]

We did a sme overkill: V^CV, when the rulebased hyphenator gave the right 
result.
For sme: Find the default, only tag the exceptions. (issue: VCsCV, VsCV)

TODO:
* Set up the mechanism for the hash transducer package - fst gymnastics, see
  above.
* add exceptions marks to the `smj` lexicon (boks^távva)
    - Status? We discussed with Kåre Tjihkkom, and the principles are clear, 
   even behaviour around -st-, but it is not implemented in the lexicon

## North Sámi

There are some heavy bugs (11 sme bugs all in all):
* he(a)ddjiid is one
* compounding cleanup - no shortening when normative, still shortening when
  analysing corpus texts?
* vowel-shortening when compounding (we need the input from Pekka!)

We should have some linguistic workshops while Maaren is here.

TODO:
* set up a linguistic workshop while Maaren is in Tromsø (and remember
  that she is on sick leave all the time) (**Trond, Thomas**)

## Lule Sámi

TODO:
* 50 unknown words left+2 abbr. +moaddi etc (numerals) need more checks
* There are some open issues in the marginal area of the smj transducer:
    - numerals, e.g. These become more visible as we get real texts.    
    - names
    - compounds? Shortening here as well, but not in written language (some
   lexicalised exceptions, as in sme)
    - loanwords?

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

TODO:
1. refactor and prepare risten.no for multiple collections:
    1.  refactor the code into more and more specific components according to our
    folder hierarchy (**Tomi, Sjur**)
        1. done for editors, some open issues for regular searches
1. write down the most common editing scenarios (to be used as guides for making
  the editing interface) (adding / changing ) (**Trond, Tomi**)
    1. Done.
1. develop the needed XQueries and interface (**Sjur, Tomi**)
    1.  developing
1. data synchronisation between risten.no and the cvs repo (**Tomi**)
    1.  nothing this week
1. test and review when ready
1. Rethink the doubletagging procedure for names, consider grammatically
  motivated semtag conversion routines ("Helsinki" from Plc to Obj to Org, 
  or the Lyndi England issue) (**Trond**)

# 9. Spellers

Nothing until the new proper noun lexicon is in place. We don't have enough
people to do both. Here's our most important targets for spellers in the near
future:

* aspell
* hunspell

# 10. Public tender

TODO:
* read the offers (**Børre, Sjur, Trond, Tomi**)
    - done
* meet on Tuesday 13 to sum up the findings (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)
    - done, need more info - questions sent
* telephone meeting next Wednesday with Finnut (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - postponed till we have more info.
* new meeting on Thursday 18.5. at 10.00 AM (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi Trond**)

# 11. Other

## Summer vacation

|   Who  | When
| --- | --- 
|  Børre  | ?
|  Linda  | ?
|  Maaren | ?
|  Saara  | July
|  Sjur   | ?
|  Thomas | 3.7 - 7.8
|  Trond  | July
|  Tomi   | 8.7 - 16.7, more?

## Bug fixing

**45** open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and **25** risten.no bugs

Guess: 1/3 of the bugs are fixed already (?)

Please help **Saara** with bug 279 (Perl locale). Not much help...
**Saara** will contact **Roy** on this issue.

After the corpus issues have been somewhat settled, we should do a bug
barnraising. ... and then a new one after the name lexicon is fixed.

##  Move to victorio

Trond's victorio problem:

```
sme:
FirstTag...1, ProperNoun...10000...
        - Warning:  Ignoring info strings.
20000...30000...flex scanner jammed
make: *** [sme/bin/sme.save] Error 2

smj:
Reading from 'smj/src/adv-smj-lex.txt'
adv...1, Adverb...1064

Reading from 'smj/src/noun-smj-lex.txt'
NounRoot...flex scanner jammed
make: *** [smj/bin/smj.save] Error 2
```

sma, kal compile without jamming.cd

Saara compiles sme without problems, has problems with smj. Conclusion: it is a
source code problem. Tomi and Børre are compiling smj just fine.

## Gobby

0.3 is working fine on Mac, Linux and Windows. Should be installed on all
computers c.f.
[http://darcs.0x539.de/trac/obby/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/InstallationGuide]
(our preinstalled Xcode veriosn is 2.0, must be 2.1):

* Børre - todo
* Maaren - Børre to do it
* Saara - todo
* Sjur - ok
* Thomas - Børre to do it
* Tomi - todo
* Trond - ok

Trond should ask Lars Nygård, Per Langgård and Tero Avellan to install
Gobby as well.
