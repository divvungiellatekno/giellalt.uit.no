# 3. Documentation

**Børre** added the new, fully i18n-ed documentation to our public site.

TODO:
* either fix forrest installations (**Sjur**), or create a new tarball
  (**Børre**)
* cvs up of the public server should be done for `xtdoc/sd/documentation/`
  (**Børre**)

# 4. Corpus gathering

**Sjur** has received a heap of Bible files from **Pia**. **Børre** will add
them to the corpus.

**TODO:**
* get `sma` Bible / NT texts (**Trond**)
    - done
* discussions with the Sámi Parliament about `sma` (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - done (by **Sjur**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## Aligner

The aligner produces empty output - not so useful:-) **Børre** has been working
on fixing this bug.

**TODO:**
* gather more parallel texts (**Trond, Børre**)
* re-analyze parallel files using the command-line version (**Saara**)

# 6. Infrastructure

## Xerox tools wrapped as servers

**TODO:**
* find a way of integrating `vislcg` as a server, or send a feature request
  to the `vislcg` developers (**Saara**)
    - move this to Bugzilla

# 7. Linguistics

## Names and multilinguality

TODO:
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## North Sámi

The latest change in sme-lex.txt:
```
 +N+SgNomCmp:   R ; ! gahpirg√°nda, ƒçoahkkinordnet
 +N+SgNomCmp:X7 R ; ! gahperg√°nda, ƒçoahkkenordnet
```

How much will this overgenerate, would it be better to have two different lexicons, or lexicalise exceptional compounding? (GAHPIR has 2329 members...)

Command to extract the relevant parts of GAHPIR words:
```
grep GAHPIR noun-sme-lex.txt | cut -d":" -f1 | cut -d" " -f1 |
cut -d"#" -f3 | cut -d"#" -f2 | rev | sort | uniq | rev | l
```

One possibility is to split GAHPIR into three lexica:
1. vowel lowering (X7)
1. no vowel lowering
1. both for the same lexeme

Another possibility could be to write two-level rules, if lowering/non-lowering
follows a certain pattern.

TODO:
* go through the class of GAHPIR words, and try to generalise the compounding
  behaviour (**Thomas**)
* change whatever is needed based on the above generalisation
  (**Thomas, Trond**)

## Lule Sámi

A lot of work has been done on the `sme` name lexicon, the `smj` copy should
be updated. Nothing new on the `smj` proper noun lexicon itself..

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* update proper noun lexicon with copy of `sme` lexicon  (**Trond**)

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decided in Tromsø:
* add logging facilities to the interface
* add option to download local copies of the lexicon files directly from the db
* batch editing (change all entries in the found set), should later be enhanced
  to allow selection of exceptions (the found set minus deselected items)
* tag for excluding/including a name from certain applications
* future epxansion: choose what info to display in the single language browser
* display existing language entries when adding a new language to a record
* add editor to change single, existing entries

Details can be found in [the meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

TODO:
* develop the needed XQueries and UI (**Sjur, Tomi**)

Postponed:
* data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and the cvs repo
* new version of xml2lexc (based on ccat), should handle complex names correct:
  construct entries like we have now from the different parts of a complex name
  entry

# 9. Spellers

## Alpha version

Was received one and a half week ago, and contains spellers for `sme` and
`smj`, as well as a `sme` hyphenator. The proofing files can be had from
**Sjur**.

## Polderland data generation

**TODO:**
* decide how to specify compounding behaviour info for the lexicon
  (**Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
    - new meeting Tuesday Dec. 19, after lunch
* add closed POS and clitics to PLX generation (**Tomi**)
    - has been working, not yet finished
* add derivations to the PLX generation (**Tomi**)
* add compound stems to the PLX generation (**Tomi**)

## Aspell

TODO when the major part of the PLX conversion is done:
* add Aspell/Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study Hunspell, perhaps also Soikko (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)

## Testing

**TODO:**
* get an Intel Mac for testing Windows spellers; get a WinXP license from SD
  (**Børre, Sjur**)
    - WinXP is sent from **SD/Leif Åge** to **Sjur** and **Børre**.

# 10. Other

## Corpus contracts

TODO:
* publish corpus contracts and project infra on NoDaLi-sta (**Sjur**)

## Bug fixing

**57** open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and **23** risten.no bugs

Guess: 1/3 of the bugs are fixed already (?)

## New Perl modules

TODO:
* write Perl module dependency documentation (**Saara**)
    - done
* update setup and installation instructions (**Børre**)

# 11. Next meeting, closing
