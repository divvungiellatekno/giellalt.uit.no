## Davvi Girji

Called **Brita Kåven**. She can't say anything about letting us have the texts
untill she has talked with the employees, to get a work estimate on their part.
Nothing was decided in their previous meeting. Davvi Girji seems generally very
positive, but has problems finding the best way of actually delivering the texts

    - done, not finished

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## General

TODO:
* remove headers and footers from antiword documents, other improvements
  as needed, including PDF conversion (**Saara**)
    - in the works, also improvements to the PDF conversion
        - problems with running the tools, they need some updated libraries in
    Victorio

## User accounts and access

For details, see the [previous meeting memo](Meeting_2006-06-19), as well as the
memo from a [dedicated
meeting|/infra/corpus_policy.html].

### Shell access

TODO:
* make a group `bound` for our external corpus users, which: (**Børre**)
    - gives access to read our bound texts
    - gives access to execute/run the tools in `/opt`
        - done
* export to `/opt` (with cron) tools that the project team members find in 
  their cvs tree (the bound users do not have a cvs tree, and therefore need 
  these tools in `/opt` in order to conduct linguistic analyses) (**Tomi**)
    - ccat (and some perl scripts?)
    - other tools?
        - nothing yet
* make shell script wrappers for the most common commands for user friendlyness
  (**Trond**)
* write user account form, probably ask for copy of existing ones from the IT
  centre (**Trond** and **Sjur**)
    - short discussion with Trond about what we need
* possibly deploy the user account form as an HTML form (**Børre**)
    - waiting for the form to be written
* write documentation for our `bound` users, with pointers to the ordinary 
  documentation (**Børre, Trond**)
    - nothing done
* write documentation for how to apply for a user account (where's the form, to
  whom do I send the form, who needs it, etc.) (**Børre**)
    - nothing
* make our own guidelines for the user application processing (**Børre**)
    - nothing
* make a test user (**Børre**)
    - nothing
* test corpus access as test user (**Trond**)
    - nothing yet

### Web browser access

TODO:
* discuss with Oslo (**Trond**)
* delay other tasks until we are ready to go public?
* user management for access to bound texts

## More texts to the graphical corpus interface:

TODO:
1. refine xml-tagged output (**Saara** and **Tomi**)
    1. done, but still open if it is finished
1. add text to the server (**Lars**)

## Aligner

More to be said about this? (certainly, but right now?)

## Language recognition

Still waiting for more **smj** text to improve it.

## Corpus summary

Forrest goes into an endless loop when processing these files. It happens when
converting the XML to Forrest format. More info on our
[bugzilla](http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=309)

It is now implemented, but a test to skip this summary option for smaller
collections did not work. Thus all genres in all languages are treated the same.

**Improvement suggestion:** instead of summarize files under a certain limit,
one could also split **Min Áigi** into years, and display it year-wise. That
will require some more info in the generated source file `corpus-content.xml`.

TODO:
* trim generated corpus summary pages (**Sjur**)
    - suggestion: lump together files with content less than X paragraphs (X < 5?)
        - done - Forrest seems to work fine now
* add improvement suggestion to Bugzilla (**Børre**)
    - done

# 6. Infrastructure

## Paradigm generation

Goal: Reuse Greenlandic code for paradigm generation.

**Saara** has given a report on the PHP code in News. Please read.

TODO:
* convert or adapt the received PHP to our needs (**Saara**)
    - code evaluated, evaluation reported

## Hyphenator

TODO:
* correct the treatment of hyphenation of word boundaries and exceptions (fst
  gymnastics) (**Sjur, Trond**)
    - nothing since last meeting
* Update the sma hyphenator rule set with the insights gained from smj updates
  (**Trond** during summer vacation)

## Automatic Bugzilla reminder for untouched bugs

TODO:
* set up Bugzilla to send automatic reminders for bugs not touched in a given
  timeframe; ask Thor-Øivind for help if needed (**Børre**)
    - turned on the feature, but it doesn't seem to work - needs some more
   investigation

## JSPWiki update

Here's the pattern to use:
```
egrep -C 3 -R "^\*.*[$]*{1,16}\#" *
```

TODO:
* grep for all occurences of ^* followed by a line ^## and vice versa (the
  patterns above) (**Sjur**)
    - Tomi tried it, but nothing found
* correct the documents found to have consistent lists (**Sjur**)
    - not done

# 7. Linguistics

## Derivation and spellers like Aspell

It is impossible to create a model that can dynamically generate new derivations
of verbs, and then let them nominalise for compounding. What we need is to
extract all derived verbs not in the lexicon, and lexicalise most of them. We
could potentially let the 5(?) most productive verbal derivations be
unlexicalised, and generate them from our lexicon directly when creating
entries. A tentive, first guess on which derivational suffixes this could be is
(for sme):

```
+st, +l, +h, -goahtit, (o)juvvot (passive)
```

Later we might consider lexicalising all other derivations found in our corpus.

To make it easier to extract all derived stems, we should enhance the tags used
for derivations in `sme` to make them easier to grep. The most straightforward
solution is to make the tags follow the same pattern as for `smj`,
`+Der/NNN`. Presently `sme` is only using the `NNN` part as a tag, where
`NNN` represents the derivational suffix. That is, there is no single pattern
to match against for `sme`. Example:

```
"<laktigohtet>"
        "laktit" V TV goahti Ind Prs Pl3 @+FMAINV
```

Only the tag `goahti` is identifying that the word form is a derivation. It
should be extended to `Der/goahti` as in `smj`. Then it is easy to grep for
the pattern `Der/` to get all derived verbs.

TODO:
* change tagging of derived stems in the disamb output, to facilitate much
  easier extraction of these verbs (**Trond**)
    - not done, the other tasks depend on this one
* find and study all derived verbs in our corpus (**Thomas**)
* suggest which derivations could be generated (**Thomas**)
    - see source code above, but also consider overgeneration problems, as well as
   input from the statistical results in the previous point
* lexicalise the rest (**Thomas**)

## Name double-tagging

TODO:
* Make a section under `gt/doc/lang/smi/`, add a chapter
  **Common linguistic resources** under the **Languages** section in
  `site-frag.xml`, and add the document below to that section (**Børre**)
* write guidelines for annotators wrt. to name tagging and put them under 
  `gt/doc/lang/smi`. A short version of the
  guidelines goes as follows: \\Systematic
  ambiguity (the **Trosterud** (plc/sur) and **Aftenposten** (org/obj) types)
  should not be doubletagged, but given primary tags (plc, org) only.
  Doubletagging should be confined to exceptional  cases (**Eira**
  (Fem/Sur/Plc), **Janne** (Fem/Mal), such things. These guidelines should be
  added to our documentation file. (**Trond**)
* when adding new names, only use one sem-tag unless there are known objects
  which belong to different sem classes(?) (**all linguists**)
* write disamb rules to implement the system above (**Trond, Linda**)

## North Sámi

TODO:
* discuss findings with all of us (**Thomas**)
* investigate and identify under which conditions Actio compounding is possible
  (**Thomas**)

Following already derived verbs are not happy with further derivation. It seems
like the most of them do not appear as Actio forms in first part of
compounding either. The following holds for both *sme* and *smj*:
```
LEXICON MUITTASJ !Words ending -šit, -skit, -smit, -idit, -ldit, -git and 
5-syllables, formerly directed to 
MUITAL
 +V+TV: MUITALStem ;
### SHOULD be directed here as well:
### Reflexives on -dit
### Reciprocals on -dit, -(a)lit
### Momentatives on -dit, -(a)lit, -ádit, -ihit
### Frequentatives on -(a)lit, -(u)hit, -dit
### Continuatives on -dit, -(u)hit, -nit
### Inchoatives in -nit 
### Translatives on -dit
### Essives on -dit and -stit
### Causatives on -dit, -stit
```

## Lule Sámi

TODO:
* add inc abbr to a new abbr lexicon file (**Thomas**)
* add proper numeral analysis/treatment (**Thomas**)
* add loanwords (e.g. latin -ere verbs) (**Thomas**)
    - nothing done to any of these

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

TODO:
* finish refactoring for multiple collections in the search interfarce
  (**Sjur**)
    - still not implemented
* develop the needed XQueries and interface (**Sjur, Tomi**)
    - done the inflection menu, but it doesn't work...
* data synchronisation between risten.no and the cvs repo (**Tomi**)
    - discussion started on eXist-list, nothing useful came up. We need to
   reformulate the question from our perspective, and bring it up again
   (**Sjur**)
        - nothing done

# 9. Public tender

We finally recieved their answer as well.

TODO:
* final evaluation based on the answers to the clarification letters
    - done
* present the final report to the board, and bring their decision into action
    - done. Decision: Polderland.
* write a contract (mostly done by **Finnut**, review by **Sjur**)
* get it signed (**Finnut, Lennart Mikkelsen**)

# 10. Other

## Summer vacation

|   Who  | When
| --- | --- 
|  Børre  | 24.7 - 20.8
|  Linda  | ?
|  Maaren | on sick leave
|  Saara  | July
|  Sjur   | 3.7 - 23.7 + single days at other times
|  Thomas | 3.7 - 7.8
|  Trond  | 3.7 - 14.8 (last two weeks off at summer school)
|  Tomi   | 8.7 - 16.7, 2 more weeks in July and/or August

## Bug fixing

**43** open Divvun/Disamb bugs (two down!), and **25** risten.no bugs

Guess: 1/3 of the bugs are fixed already (?)

Please help **Saara** with [bug
279|http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=279]
 (Perl locale). Not much help...
**Saara** will contact **Roy** on this issue.

## Gobby

TODO:
* install Gobby (**Saara**)
* document its use within our project (**Børre**)
    - done
* review the [document](/tools/gobby.html) (**Thomas**)

## SEE 2.5 extensions

Future extensions and wish modes:
* write a perl script to extract all TODO items and sort them according to
  responsible person; wrap the script in a AppleScript available from the menu
* twol mode
* xfst mode
* lexc mode
* vislcg mode

TODO:
* move the above list to Bugzilla (**Sjur**)
    - done

## Task lists as iCal entries

This feature requires that the patch Sjur sent in to Forrest regarding parsing
of nested lists within wiki documents is applied. It was applied to Forrest last
Friday, thus all who is interested in using this feature from their local
Forrest should update their installation. It is easiest done using Subversion
(svn) to update your local copy.

TODO:
* create iCal entries from our meeting memos (**Sjur** or **Børre**)
    - done (**Sjur**)
* update all forrest installations to latest svn HEAD (**Børre**)

## Project meeting in Tromsø in august?

The project board has decided upon a meeting in Tromsø in august. We'll discuss
the date later this week.
