!!!3. Documentation

!!Changes and updates because of the Divvun public tender

TODO:
* document anonymous, read-only access to our cvs repo (__Børre__)
** done
* review: Sjur, Saara, by Wednesday morning
* probably a new main section (sub-tab?) on external access to all our resources
* documentation on how to apply for a user account for the corpus repo
  (__Børre__)
**  Not done
* we need to finish the corpus dtd documentation (__Saara__)

Permlink location for all our dtd's (filename will vary, of course):
{{{
http://giellatekno.uit.no/dtd/corpus.dtd
}}}
This corresponds to the dir {{~/gt/public_html/dtd/}} on our public web server.
The DTD's has to be manually copied to this location, but since they don't
change that often, that shouldn't be a big problem.

TODO:
* copy updated DTD's to the permlink location (__Børre__ or __Saara__)

!!!4. Corpus gathering

!!Collecting

See a [previous meeting memo|Meeting_2006-01-16] for what's to be done.

TODO: Send out the rest of the letters (__Børre__)

!!Odin

Waiting for __Sæth__ to discuss with colleagues about how to implement the
cooperation, and return to us.

TODO:
* call Sæth (__Børre__)
** Not done.

!!Olavi Korhonen's Lule Sámi dictionary.

Korhonen and Oahpadusguovdásj have a shared copyright to the dictionary.
They are both very positive.

!! KIO Grafisk and the Iđut books

Iđut and KIO Grafisk won't give access to their Quark files, due to copyright
issues with fonts and pictures. It is a principle for them.

Citations from one of the discussions we have had with Quark experts:

* Trond: Can you confirm that I can get a quark file from you WITHOUT at the
same time receiving the fonts?
* Michael: Of course. Quark files do not embed fonts. They are in the Fonts
folder.
* Trond: what about pictures?
* Michael: However, if I send you a Quark file and you don't have the fonts, it
will display with other fonts and will look bad. A low-quality image of a
picture will appear when you import one into Quark, but the main picture that
the printer uses is in a separate file.

__TODO__:
* __Børre__ will send letters to the authors.
* send an e-mail explaining the issues as we see them, to Iđut and KIO Grafisk,
  and with a copy to the head of the project board (Anne Britt). This e-mail
  will be our last effort to try to get the Iđut material in its corrected form.
  (__Sjur__ and __Børre__)

!!Bible texts

TODO:
* review paratext2xml converter (__Saara__)
* convert smj NT to paratext (__Børre__)
* ask to get fin and swe NT and OT in __paratext__ format. (__Trond__)
**  Still not done. __Trond__ has contacted Bibelselskapet for a new sme
    version, and the issue is under discussion.

!!!5. Corpus infrastructure

TODO in transferring the old gt/sme/corp files to the new corpus repo:
* for the biggest top ten (or so) the orig. should be located and copied to the
  new corpus repo (__Trond__)
** done
* then these files should be removed from gt/sme/corp/ (__Trond/Børre__)
** done
* all small files could just be forgotten/ignored
* make sure there's nothing left with a copyright attached to it (__Trond__)
** Trond will go a second round

TODO for access control:
* Access control to corpus repo resolved through Unix groups: one group for
  corpus maintainers with write access, and another for corpus users, with
  read-only access. Still not done.
** __Saara__ has asked for a *nix group - use it when created
*** done


Further discussion about corpus analysis and computer use:

* we need to develop strong enough security routines for the G5 to fulfill our
  obligations towards the text licensers
**  TODO: __Børre__ to move this to bugzilla

TODO dtd usage and documentation:
* corpus dtd documentation:
** structure, content/model and location of the dtd (location =
   permlink) http://giellatekno.uit.no/dtd/corpus.dtd
   TODO: __Saara__ to write and finish the docu, also check the dtd link
*** see above under documentation for details.
* add xml validation against our dtd to the corpus conversion process
  (__Saara__)

!!HTML conversion problem

We need to extract only the table from input like below, since our DTD does not
allow tables to be nested inside paragraphs. Cf newsgroup message from
__Saara__.

{{{
<p>
  <table>
  ...
  </table>
</p>
}}}

The solution is a simple XSL template that will only match the relevant
structures, and then "eat" the paragraphs before continue processing of the
table:
{{{
  <xsl:template match="p[table]">
    <xsl:apply-templates select="./table">
  </xsl:template>
}}}

!!Correction tags?

There are many scenarios where information about spelling and other errors is
useful, especially if combined with the correct string. As a simple way of
marking up such info, __Sjur__ proposed the following in the newsgroup:
{{{
... this is <error correct="text">tekst</error> with an error...
}}}
No problem in adding it to the DTD, together with corresponding info in the
header/meta part. That info should be a single element stating that/whether it
was manually edited for corrections. Absence of this element is the same as the
document __NOT__ being edited.

TODO:
* update the DTD (__Saara__)

OPEN ISSUES:
* since this is manual editing, we break the automatic regeneration/reconversion
  principle. Either we track each change when we find such editions in the
  existing version before re-conversion, and apply them again after the
  re-conversion, or we have to find another way of preserving them across
  conversion generations. Anyway, this is now left as an open issue, and added
  to Bugzilla (__Sjur__)
* the proposed markup is too simplistic for describing more complex error
  patterns, e.g. when two different errors overlap or intertwine. One could
  allow nested error markup to cover cases with a syntactic error surrounding a
  spelling error (one error tag for the syntax error, another inside for the
  spelling error. To be further discussed in the newsgroup.

!!Changes and updates because of the Divvun public tender

User account admin and infra: see [previous
  memo|/doc/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-06.html].

TODO: see above under ''Documentation.''

Automatic build of the content of our corpus repo: also see [previous
  memo|/doc/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-06.html].

TODO:
* extract meta info into a compact xml document, the xml should be stored in the
  Forrest docu tree; set up cron task for the extraction (__Saara__)
** done
* discuss and decide upon the structure of the generated xml above (Sjur and
  Saara, news)
** done
* convert from that xml to Forrest document format (__Sjur__)
** looked at the generated file, nothing more yet
* integrate the final Forrest documents into Forrest, and make sure it gets
  published (__Børre__)
** waiting for the above

!!Free and non-free texts

More info in the [previous meeting
memo.|/doc/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-13.html]

TODO:
* update scripts to handle this dichotomy. (__Saara__)
** almost finished

!! More texts to the graphical corpus interface:

* We would like to have more than the NT in the graphical interface (__Saara__)
* We would like to have grammatical searchability, not only POS. (__Saara__,
  __Trond__)
* This presupposes a discussion with Oslo. (__Trond__ to start discussion 
  and __Trond__ and __Saara__  to continue

* For Lule Sámi: We would like to have a parallel corpus interface with NT
  (text only). This presupposes better quality texts (__Trond, Børre__)
** Better Lule NT text still not made.

!!!6. Infrastructure

We need to set up anonymous, read-only access to our cvs repo as outlined by our
friend in Skolelinux.

Howto/who:
* what do we need?
** web interface? maybe, not required
** command line check-out? yes (__Roy Dragseth__/__Børre__)
** need to be able to restrict anonymous cvs to only specific modules
   (__Roy Dragseth__/__Børre__)
*** done
* testing needed: (__Saara, Sjur__)

!!Aligner

TODO:
* Read documentation and try out, give feedback to Bergen. (__Trond__,
  __Saara__, __Tomi__)
** __Trond__ to send relevant documents to __Tomi__.
* Translate the stopword list __anchor-eng-nor.txt__ into sme (and fin?) 
(__Tomi__), and into smj (__Thomas__ or __Anders Urheim__) (and nno? __Trond__).
Note that the format is "lang1 / lang2", and that the number of lines should be
kept in order to make it possible to move from one language to the next.
** __Saara__ to install the aligner, everyone to read the documentation on
   Tuesday and Wednesday, and then we have a meeting on it later this week.

!!Language recogniser

We don't have enough Finnish text. We will look at the Helsinki corpus
(__Saara__).
* This is documented in bug database.
 
!!!7. Linguistics

!!North Sámi

TODO:
* document all past decisions in our normativity document (__Thomas__)
**done
* decide on a semantic feature system for nouns (__Linda__).
  This is needed for the sme locative/comitative issue. We looked at the feature
  system made by Eckhard Bick - Eckhard Bick: "The parsing system "palavras"",
  p.372ff. The top of the feature tree looks like the following:

{{{
                                 Concrete
                   +/                             \-
            Animate                                 Verbal Content
        +/           \-                            +/            \-
      Human          Moving                  Control               Mass
     +/    \-      +/      \-               +/     \-            +/    \-
#humans# Moving #vehicles# Movable    Perfective Perfective #features# Count 
.......
}}}

TODO:
* Work with semantically based sets (__Trond, Linda__)
* Return to the infrastructure issue (__Trond__)
* A full semantic encoding of the lexicon is a future project, outside the
  scope of both divvun and disamb, but the ground work for such a project will
  be laid now.

Semantic tags we already have:
Actio
Plc (for proper nouns such as "London London+N+Prop+Plc+Sg+Nom")

Place names:

Now: Tags Plc Sur and combinations (London, Trosterud).

Problem:
19000 Plc
  900 SurPlc (Trosterud BERN-surplc) Oslo sur. Berlin Bonn?
10500 Sur 

* Solution A:
** Heavily retag the lexicon: London also as Sur (Jack)

* Solution B: Do not use (new..) double tags.
** Plc being the default tag for Plc/Sur ("if it can be Plc, it is Plc)
** Sur being the tag of things that cannot be places (Andersen)
** Then cg rules turning Plc into &Plc and &Sur, and Sur into &Sur.
** Then rules for interpreting London, Trosterud, etc. as &Sur.
** Then a final rule for removing ambiguous ones (remove Plc &Sur strings).

* Solution C compromise:
** Real placenames Menešjávri
** Convertible placenames (today's double) England, Bonn, (default)
** Real surnames Andersen, Johansson

TODO (__Trond__):
# Discussion testing
# infrastructure
# semiatomatic retagging

!!Lule Sámi

TODO:
* add the rest of the inc- words (__Thomas__)
**still working on it, should finish this week
* name morphology (__Thomas__)
**handed Tomi list
* oslolaš for smj (__Tomi__)
** done
* translate Northern Sámi lists and sets to Lule Sámi
** __Linda, Trond__, with help from mother tongue speakers (__Thomas__, others).
   Work in progress.

Trond will go to Drag tomorrow. Issues for the trip? No unobvious ones.

!!!8. Name lexicon infrastructure

!!Complex names

* make sure xml2lexc can handle complex names in ways compatible with our
  present tool chain (=reconstruct the lexc format we have now) (__Tomi__)
** the resulting file format should be identical to our present prop-name
   file (=lexc), that can then be converted to our new xml format using the same
   script as for the regular names (__Tomi__ or __Saara__, but only when the
   technical details are settled)

TODO:
* Move this issue to bugzilla (__Børre__)

!!XML format

TODO on eXist as editor:
# refactor and prepare risten.no for multiple collections:
## develop the Cocoon sitemap to delegate requests to the proper folder level,
   such that the most specific code is always used (__Sjur__)
### Progressing well
## refactor the code into more and more specific components according to our
   folder hierarchy (__Tomi__)
# develop the needed XQueries and interface (__Sjur, Tomi__)
# data synchronisation between risten.no and the cvs repo (__Tomi__)
## done some, but it didn't work out, will need to start on a different trail
# test whether eXist as editor is actually working well (__linguists__)

Data synchronisation task list/specification:

* the xml file needs to be stored/updated in cvs
* there should be no diffs on whitespace and sorting order (to ensure we get
  only substantial diffs, and no noise)
* the prop name update cycle should something like:
** dump the xml from eXist (in proper sorting order)
** check whether there are diffs against cvs; continue only if there are
** update from cvs
** error check: are there conflicts? if yes, send report to <somebody>
** are there still diffs? if yes, continue:
** check in/commit w. generated comment
** error check: is the document valid and conformant xml? if no, stop and send a
   report to <somebody>
** reimport the xml file into eXist
* question: do we need to lock the file in eXist through this update cycle?
* the update cycle should be a nightly cron job



!!!9. Spellers

Nothing until the new proper noun lexicon is in place.

!!!10. Other

!!Gobby

A cross-platform alternative to SubEthaEdit, Gobby, is now available for OS X
through DarwinPorts. I haven't tested it in collaborative use, but it is worth
looking at for collaboration involving Windows and Linux users.

Requirements for easy install:
* DarwinPorts ([http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/])
* Port Authority (GUI for DarwinPorts)
  ([http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_open_source/portauthority.html])

Install and run the above as admin user. Then find and install Gobby (hint: use
the search field), and wait. It took something like 8 hours on my computer to
download, compile and install all dependencies, but there was no problems,
hicups or other complications. When finished, open X11, and just type 'gobby' in
any terminal window.

!!Bug fixing

__35__ open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and __25__ risten.no bugs

!!SPR language policy decision

Last week's SPR meeting decided upon a language policy. Their decision was the
following (cf. their meeting minutes for the final version):

«En fungerende språklig infrastruktur er av avgjørende betydning for at de
samiske språkene skal kunne fungere som bruksspråk i et moderne samfunn. I en
slik infrastruktur inngår en velutviklet terminologi, enspråklige ordbøker,
ordbøker og lærebøker de samiske språkene i mellom, uttømmende grammatikker som
gir informasjon om alle sider ved språket, og språkprogrammer som gjør det mulig
å søke etter informasjon, finne termer, rette skrivefeil og grammatikk, og
oversette maskinelt fra ett språk til et annet. For å få dette til trengs det
representative tekstsamlinger, helst på flere hundre millioner ord, både
enspråklige og parallellspråklige, det trengs grammatisk og språkteknologisk
forsking. SPR sin rolle er å legge til rette for dette arbeidet.»
