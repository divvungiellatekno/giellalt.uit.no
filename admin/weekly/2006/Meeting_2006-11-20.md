# 3. Documentation

TODO:
* update all forrest installations, including local patches (**Børre**)
* port all i18n work to the main branch (from the i18n branch) (**Børre**)

# 4. Corpus gathering

**Trond** talked with **Bierna Bientie**, got permission to use the texts, so
far as bound texts. We shall contact SD to get the texts they have there, he
will send whatever they don't have.

The texts at SD are available via **Sig-Britt Persson**, **Sjur** will ask her
about them.

**TODO:**
* get `sma` Bible / NT texts (**Trond**)
    - partly done
* Discussions with the Sámi Parliament about `sma` (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
* send the filename renaming script to NSI; get their corpus (**Børre**)
* ask SD/Sig-Britt Persson about some of the South Sámi bible texts (**Sjur**)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

Nothing new on any of the sub-issues.

## User accounts and access

TODO:
* add the issue with subissues to Bugzilla (**Trond**)
    - done

## More texts to the graphical corpus interface:

No new texts available in the web interface yet. **Saara** and **Trond** have
got access to the Oslo computer, and could in principle add texts themselves.
Some instructions will be necessary, though.

TODO:
* add text to the server (**Lars**)
* Discuss with Lars (**Trond**)

## Aligner

**Øystein Reigem** has commented **Børre's** work, and will perhaps look at it.

**TODO:**
* gather more parallel texts (**Trond**)
* try out NT alignment strategies (**Saara**)

## Language recognition

TODO:

* get more `sma` texts, first the Bible / NT (**Trond**)
    - done, more forthcoming

# 6. Infrastructure

## Xerox tools wrapped as servers

Tomi has modified the server a bit, causing it to **NOT** work with the perl
client at the moment. It should not be a big deal to fix it (three lines?).
**Saara** will fix it.

The paradigm grammar needs to be written for Saara to be able to finish the
server. The format should follow the Noun sample below:

```
N+Number+Case+Possessive?+Clitic?
A
V
Adv
```

Can we do without clitics? We would like to just list them in a PLX format that
allows correct behaviour:

```
Is
InC lex
MeC lex
FiC clit
```

That is, we want `mánás + go` to be accepted, without letting `mánás` make
compounds freely. We don't know how to specify this in the PLX format. **Sjur**
will discuss clitics with Polderland, to solve this issue.

**TODO:**
* finalise the paradigm generator (requires paradigm grammar) (**Saara**)
* fix the corpus tag list in the `cwb/` directory (**Trond**)
* create / check the paradigm grammar as exemplified above (**Thomas**)
* update the generating transducer to only be normative, and without the
  subclass tags (**Sjur**)
* discuss clitics in PLX format with Polderland (**Sjur**)
* update the corpus/cwb tags (**Trond**)

## Hyphenator

TODO:
* make new list of unrecognised forms (**Sjur**)
    - tried but failed because of problems with the Xerox tools
* investigate unrecognised word forms (**Maaren, Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)

# 7. Linguistics

## Names and multilinguality

```
In the terms-sme.xml file:
<entry id="Helsset">
  <appl excl="speller,hyph"/> -- just an example! --
  <infl lexc="BERN"/>
  <senses>
    <sense ref="Helsingfors"/>
  </senses>
</entry>

<entry id="Helsingfors" type="secondary">
  <appl incl="disamb, IR" />
  <infl lexc="BERN"/>
  <senses>
    <sense ref="Helsingfors"/>
  </senses>
</entry>
```

TODO:
* separate meeting for discussing this issue, Tuesday 14.11 after
  lunch (12.30) (**Trond, Thomas, Sjur**)
    - done; new tasks added below

TODO:
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur, Tomi**)
1. add @type=secondary and @excl=speller,hyph to all names marked with !SUB
  (**Saara**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add nob as
  well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, Maaren, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

### Cohort policy

A further issue is whether we should reconsider our cohort policy. Today, Sur
and Plc are **different** readings. An alternative would be to have them as
secondary tags, not in conflict with each other:

```
"<Trosterud>"
        "Trosterud" N Prop Sur Sg Nom <<< @HNOUN
        "Trosterud" N Prop Plc Sg Nom <<< @HNOUN
"<Trosterud>"
        "Trosterud" N Prop Sg Nom <Sur> <Plc> <<< @HNOUN
"<Trosterud>"
        "Trosterud" N Prop Sg Nom &Sur &Plc <<< @HNOUN
```

This issue is dependent on CG3, and is delayed untill we know more about the
possibilities with it.

## Derivation and spellers like Aspell

TODO:
* redo the work for `smj`, including discussion regarding *Actio*
  (**Thomas, Sjur, Trond**)

## North Sámi

The following words are included in the normative list despite being marked
with !SUB:

```
accompagnerejun
ábuhuvvože
ábuhuvvože      ábuhit+V+TV+Pass+Pot+Prs+Du1
áccohallagođežedne
```

TODO:
* investigate the generated word form list sent to Polderland - use the command
  `make wordlist TARGET=sme` in *victorio* (**Maaren**, **Thomas**)
* check why some SUB-marked entries got included in the normative transducer
  (**Thomas, Sjur**)

## Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine `smj` proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**)
* hire new linguist (**Sjur**)

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decided in Tromsø:
* add logging facilities to the interface
* add option to download local copies of the lexicon files directly from the db
* batch editing (change all entries in the found set), should later be enhanced
  to allow selection of exceptions (the found set minus deselected items)
* tag for excluding/including a name from certain applications
* future epxansion: choose what info to display in the single language browser
* display existing language entries when adding a new language to a record
* add editor to change single, existing entries

Details can be found in [the meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

TODO:
* develop the needed XQueries and UI (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add a simple password protection to risten.no in the G5 (**Børre**)

Postponed:
* data synchronisation between risten.no and the cvs repo
* new version of xml2lexc (based on ccat), should handle complex names correct:
  construct entries like we have now from the different parts of a complex name
  entry

# 9. Spellers

## Polderland data generation

**Tomi** has made the first version of the PLX data generation, it ran for 6,5
hours before it crashed, and generated all entries until line `13639` in the
`noun-sme-lex.txt` file (*njuvdin*):
```
13639 njuvdin:njuvdim BOAHTIN ;
```

The generated PLX file contains `1 439 273` lines, roughly 32 Mb.

**Tomi:** The hyphenator produces multiple suggestions. **Sjur:** it needs to be
used with the hyphenation filter.

**TODO:**
* decide how to specify compounding behaviour info for the lexicon
  (**Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
* make first version of the PLX data generation (**Tomi**)
    - done
* add hyphenation points to the generated output (**Tomi**)
    - done
* update the hyphenation filter to always return one - if there are multiple
  alternatives after all the other filtering, pick the one with the most
  hyphenation points (**Saara**)
* make PLX lexicon for all open POSes (**Tomi**)
* add derivations to the PLX generation (**Tomi**)
* add compound stems to the PLX generation (**Tomi**)
* add closed POS and clitics to PLX generation (**Tomi**)

## Automatic testing of the Word spellchecker

It should be possible to write a script that runs texts through Word from the
command line, using a combination of shell script and AppleScript. MS Word has
the needed AppleScript commands to run the spell checker.

TODO:
* consider a script for automatic testing (**Sjur, Børre**)
* consider more testing routines (**Sjur, Børre**)
* consider infra for testing feedback (**Børre, Sjur**)
* get an Intel Mac for testing Windows spellers; get a WinXP license from SD
  (**Børre, Sjur**)

## Aspell

**Børre** has worked on the Aspell code, mainly to be able to explain how it
works and help out **Petter Reinholdtsen**, who would like to include the
Aspell `sme` speller in Linux distributions. He already gave back some
improvements to our code.

TODO:
* revitalize the Aspell work (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)
    - Børre and Tomi did some

TODO when the major part of the PLX conversion is done:
* add Aspell/Hunspell data generation to the lexc2xspell (**Tomi** - after the
  PLX data generation is finished)
* study Hunspell, perhaps also Soikko (**Børre, Sjur, Tomi**)

# 10. Other

## Corpus contracts

TODO:
* check corpus contract issue in a meeting Wednesday 9.30
  (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - done
* publish corpus contracts and project infra on NoDaLi-sta (**Sjur**)

## Bug fixing

**62** open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and **24** risten.no bugs

Guess: 1/3 of the bugs are fixed already (?)

## Task lists as iCal entries

TODO:
* update Maaren's Forrest installation to r430284 (**Børre**)

## Employee seminar in Alta

SD has an employee seminar in Alta 7.-8. December - should we go there? Yes.

TODO:
* ask Julie Eira about SD employee seminar (**Sjur**)
    - done
* send in hotel room list (**Divvun**)

# 11. Next meeting, closing
