!!!3. Documentation

TODO:
* update all forrest installations, including local patches (__Børre__)
** did some
* port all i18n work to the main branch (from the i18n branch) (__Børre__)



!!!4. Corpus gathering

__TODO:__
* continue to help NSI to get their corpus (__Børre__)
** fixed their filename renaming script
* get {{sma}} Bible / NT texts (__Trond__)
** still no contact with the priest
* Discussions with the Sámi Parliament about {{sma}} (__Børre, Sjur__)
* send the filename renaming script to NSI; get their corpus (__Børre__)



!!!5. Corpus infrastructure

Nothing new on any of the sub-issues.

!!User accounts and access

TODO:
* add the issue with subissues to Bugzilla (__Trond__)



!!More texts to the graphical corpus interface:

TODO:
* add text to the server (__Lars__)



!!Aligner

__TODO:__
* report improvements in aligner back to __Øystein__ (__Børre__)
** done
* gather more parallel texts (__Trond__)
* try out NT alignment strategies (__Saara__)


!!Language recognition

TODO:

* get more {{sma}} texts, first the Bible / NT (__Trond__)



!!!6. Infrastructure

!!Xerox tools wrapped as servers

Tomi has modified the server a bit, causing it to __NOT__ work with the perl
client at the moment. It should not be a big deal to fix it (three lines?).
__Saara__ will fix it.

__TODO:__
* improve and finish the present prototype (__Saara__)
** done, except for the paradigm generation (needs paradigm grammar)
* fix the corpus tag list in the {{cwb/}} directory (__Trond__)
* create / check the paradigm grammar as exemplified above (__Thomas__)
** not done



!!Hyphenator

TODO:
* make new list of unrecognised forms (__Sjur__)
* investigate unrecognised word forms (__Maaren, Thomas, Trond, Sjur__)



!!!7. Linguistics

!!Names and multilinguality

We need a more principled approach to this.

Background: the name lexicon is getting attention from the SD name/terminology
sections, and they would like to use our name lexicon also for public searching.

Observations:

1) Multilinguality is always optional.

2) We can observe that "foreign" names in texts follows a domination pattern:
majority language forms can be found in minority language texts as real names
("Kautokeino produkter"), whereas minority language names ''almost always''
occur in majority language texts as citations. And citations should not be
considered a natural part of the text.

3) When looking at our name classification, multilinguality varies according to:

{{{
Ani - weak/none? (pet, myth anim.  names)
Fem - weak (informative)
Mal - weak (informative)
Obj - strong
Org - strong
Plc - strong for the national and country names, weak (informative) for foreign
       names
Sur - none
Tit - strong (titles)
}}}

Suggestion:

We need to reconsider the ''all names in all languages'' policy. That policy is
valid only for {{Fem, Mal,}} and {{Sur}} (and Ani and Tit?). For
{{Obj, Org, Plc}} the rule should be that if they have multilingual names, each
name should only be used in it's own language. Then we need a modification
saying that majority language names can be included in minority language
lexicons __if attested__ in our corpus. Also, the majority language varies
according to country (obviously), which means that in a speller context, we
might consider tailoring spellers for each country, leaving out noise relating
to majority language names from another country.

A further issue is whether we should reconsider our cohort policy. Today, Sur
and Plc are __different__ readings. An alternative would be to have them as
secondary tags, not in conflict with each other:

{{{
"<Trosterud>"
        "Trosterud" N Prop Sur Sg Nom <<< @HNOUN
        "Trosterud" N Prop Plc Sg Nom <<< @HNOUN
"<Trosterud>"
        "Trosterud" N Prop Sg Nom <Sur> <Plc> <<< @HNOUN
"<Trosterud>"
        "Trosterud" N Prop Sg Nom &Sur &Plc <<< @HNOUN
}}}

TODO:
* separate meeting for discussing this issue, Tuesday 14.11 after
  lunch (12.30) (__Trond, Thomas, Sjur__)



!!Derivation and spellers like Aspell

Done all for {{sme}}, needs to be redone for (or ported to) {{smj}}.

TODO:
* find and study all derived words in our corpus (__Thomas__ and __Trond__)
** done
* suggest which derivations could be generated (__Thomas__)
** done
* lexicalise the rest (__Thomas__)
** to be done as they are found
* redo the work for {{smj}}, including discussion regarding ''Actio''
  (__Thomas, Sjur, Trond__)



!!North Sámi

The following words are included in the normative list despite being marked
with !SUB:

{{{
accompagnerejun
ábuhuvvože
ábuhuvvože      ábuhit+V+TV+Pass+Pot+Prs+Du1
áccohallagođežedne
}}}

TODO:
* investigate the generated word form list sent to Polderland - use the command
  {{make pl-wordlist TARGET=sme}} in ''victorio'' (__Maaren__, __Thomas__)
** done, to be redone (many times:-)
* check why some SUB-marked entries got included in the normative transducer
  (__Thomas, Sjur__)
* remove comparation from ''-laš'' derivations (__Thomas, Sjur__)
** done


!!Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine {{smj}} proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (__Thomas, Trond__)
** __Trond__ had a short look at it, needs more work
* hire new linguist (__Sjur__)



!!!8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decided in Tromsø:
* add logging facilities to the interface
* add option to download local copies of the lexicon files directly from the db
* batch editing (change all entries in the found set), should later be enhanced
  to allow selection of exceptions (the found set minus deselected items)
* tag for excluding/including a name from certain applications
* future epxansion: choose what info to display in the single language browser
* display existing language entries when adding a new language to a record
* add editor to change single, existing entries


Details can be found in [the meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

TODO:
* develop the needed XQueries and UI (__Sjur, Tomi__)
* add a simple password protection to risten.no in the G5 (__Børre__)

Postponed:
* data synchronisation between risten.no and the cvs repo
* new version of xml2lexc (based on ccat), should handle complex names correct:
  construct entries like we have now from the different parts of a complex name
  entry


!!!9. Spellers

!!Speller data generation

__Tomi__ has made further improvements to the lexc2xspell code, and __Sjur__ and
__Tomi__ had a short meeting on the feature set of it. We have asked for the
full PLX specification to be able to output correct entries.

__TODO:__
* decide how to specify compounding behaviour info for the lexicon
  (__Thomas, Trond, Sjur__)
* make first version of the PLX data generation (__Tomi__)
* add hyphenation points to the generated output (__Tomi__)


!!Automatic testing of the Word spellchecker

It should be possible to write a script that runs texts through Word from the
command line, using a combination of shell script and AppleScript. MS Word has
the needed AppleScript commands to run the spell checker.

TODO:
* consider a script for automatic testing (__Sjur, Børre__)
* consider more testing routines (__Sjur, Børre__)
* consider infra for testing feedback (__Børre, Sjur__)
* get an Intel Mac for testing Windows spellers; get a WinXP license from SD
  (__Børre, Sjur__)

!!Aspell

__Børre__ has worked on the Aspell code, mainly to be able to explain how it
works and help out one external, interested person.

Further discussion was forgotten, will be brought up in the next meeting.

TODO:
* revitalize the Aspell work (__Børre, Sjur, Tomi__)



!!!10. Other

!!Corpus contracts

TODO:
* check corpus contract issue in a meeting Wednesday 9.30
  (__Børre, Sjur, Trond__)
* publish corpus contracts and infra on NoDaLi-sta (__Sjur__)



!!Bug fixing

__61__ open Divvun/Disamb bugs, and __24__ risten.no bugs

Guess: 1/3 of the bugs are fixed already (?)


!!Task lists as iCal entries

TODO:
* update Maaren's Forrest installation to r430284 (__Børre__)



!!Employee seminar in Alta

SD has an employee seminar in Alta 7.-8. December - should we go there? __Sjur__
will ask __Julie Eira__ if we have to go there.

TODO:
* ask Julie Eira about SD employee seminar (__Sjur__)
