* documentation on how to apply for a user account for the corpus repo
  (__Børre__)
**  Not done
* we need to finish the corpus dtd documentation (__Saara__)
** done

TODO:
* copy updated DTD's to the permlink location (__Børre__ or __Saara__)
** done

!!!4. Corpus gathering

!!Collecting

See a [previous meeting memo|Meeting_2006-01-16] for what's to be done.

TODO: Send out the rest of the letters (__Børre__)

__Børre__ has sent a letter to the publishers, has talked to Brita Kåven (she
was positive), to Bård Eriksen (Báhko), and has mailed to Dát. Has talked to Min
Áigi, they will have a meeting on Monday (today). Áššu will collect text. Has
contacted Audhild Schanche at NSI, she would look at the contracts and said they
would work out a solution. She also mentioned Dieđut.

!!Odin

Waiting for __Sæth__ to discuss with colleagues about how to implement the
cooperation, and return to us.

TODO:
* call Sæth (__Børre__)
** I have mailed him, not able to reach him by phone. No answer yet, though …

!!Olavi Korhonen's Lule Sámi dictionary.

Korhonen and Oahpadusguovdásj have a shared copyright to the dictionary.
They are both very positive.
* No news this week

!! KIO Grafisk and the Iđut books

* __Sjur__has sent an e-mail explaining the issues as we see them, to Anne Britt
  (the head of the project board) and Per Edvard Klemetsen (member of the
  board). We will first see whether we can get an agreement with other
  publishers, then try to get a meeting with the publishers and a member of the
  Sámi Parliament council.  If that fails as well we will have no means to get
  texts from them. If so, we will forget about Iđut, and go directly to the
  authors.

__TODO__:
* __Børre__ will send letters to the authors

!!Bible texts

We will get text from Finland. We are awaiting an answer from Sweden. As for the
last html versions from Norway, the people have been very busy the last weeks. 
__Saara__ has made the paratext2xml converter.

TODO:
* review paratext2xml converter (__Saara__)
** converter corrected/made, use suffix .ptx when converting.
* convert smj NT to paratext (__Børre__)
** Will be done now that the paratext2xml has been finished.
* ask to get fin and swe NT and OT in __paratext__ format. (__Trond__)
**  Work in progress/texts underway.

!!!5. Corpus infrastructure

TODO in transferring the old gt/sme/corp files to the new corpus repo:
* make sure there's nothing left with a copyright attached to it (__Trond__)
** __Trond__ will go a second round
*** done
* remove the deleted files from the CVS repository (__Trond__)

Further discussion about corpus analysis and computer use:

* we need to develop strong enough security routines for the G5 to fulfill our
  obligations towards the text licensers
** TODO: __Børre__ to move this to bugzilla

TODO dtd usage and documentation:
* corpus dtd documentation:
** structure, content/model and location of the dtd (location = permlink):
   {{http://giellatekno.uit.no/dtd/corpus.dtd}}
** TODO: __Saara__ to write and finish the docu, also check the dtd link
*** done
* add xml validation against our dtd to the corpus conversion process
  (__Saara__)
** done. Some new errors were found, they are almost fixed now.
* add UTF-8 check as part of the validation (__Saara__)

!!Correction tags?

TODO:
* update the DTD (__Saara__)
** done.

OPEN ISSUES:
* since this is manual editing, we break the automatic regeneration/reconversion
  principle. Either we track each change when we find such editions in the
  existing version before re-conversion, and apply them again after the
  re-conversion, or we have to find another way of preserving them across
  conversion generations. Anyway, this is now left as an open issue, and added
  to Bugzilla (__Sjur__)
** done
* the proposed markup is too simplistic for describing more complex error
  patterns, e.g. when two different errors overlap or intertwine. One could
  allow nested error markup to cover cases with a syntactic error surrounding a
  spelling error (one error tag for the syntax error, another inside for the
  spelling error. To be further discussed in the newsgroup.
** discussed, and nesting added as well

!!Changes and updates because of the Divvun public tender

User account admin and infra: see [previous
  memo|/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-06.html].

TODO: see above under ''Documentation.''

Automatic build of the content of our corpus repo: also see [previous
  memo|/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-06.html].

TODO:
* convert from that xml to Forrest document format (__Sjur__)
** nothing last week
* integrate the final Forrest documents into Forrest, and make sure it gets
  published (__Børre__)
** waiting for the above

!!Free and non-free texts

More info in a [previous meeting
memo.|/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-13.html]

Newsgroup discussion - whether to rename gt/ to gtbound/ or not:

__Saara:__
I was thinking of the scripts the users have of their own (if they
have) and trying to avoid changes in already existing system. But if you prefer
gtbound, I'll do the changes right away.

__Sjur:__
Let's evaluate this in the next meeting. I would prefer gtbound/ over just gt/
for clarity's sake and future newcomers, so if the workload isn't too high, I
would still like you to change it. We'll discuss and decide on Monday.

__Solution:__
Use a symbolic link to handle backwards compatibility.

TODO:
* update scripts to handle this dichotomy. (__Saara__)
** almost finished
* gt/ vs gtbound/: change to gtbound/, add symbolic link from gt/ to gtbound/
  (__Saara__)

!!More texts to the graphical corpus interface:

TODO:
* We would like to have more than the NT in the graphical interface (__Saara__)
* We would like to have grammatical searchability, not only POS. (__Saara__,
  __Trond__)
* This presupposes a discussion with Oslo. (__Trond__ to start discussion 
  and __Trond__ and __Saara__  to continue
* For Lule Sámi: We would like to have a parallel corpus interface with NT
  (text only). This presupposes better quality texts (__Trond, Børre__)
** Better Lule NT text still not made.
* preparations: gather more texts (we are doing this)
* Review the tag list and have it ready for inclusion (gt/cwb/korpustags.txt)
  (__Trond, Linda__)
* Prepare a list of good candicates for first inclusion into the corpus.
  (__Trond, Linda__)

!!Text upload

The upload is working, but __Børre__ doesn't receive an automatic message
whenever a new text is being uploaded. __Saara__ has made a procedure, but
hasn't turned it on, since she didn't know whether the email address was
working.

TODO:
* Ask for email-address: corpus@giellatekno.uit.no (__Børre__)
* Make a setup for this email address so that it goes to __Børre__, and then
  turn on the procedure (__Saara__)

!!!6. Infrastructure

!!Aligner

We are working on it, there are problems, and the test files are not good
enough.

TODO:
* Read documentation and try out, give feedback to Bergen. (__Trond__,
  __Saara__, __Tomi__)
** __Trond__ to send relevant documents to __Tomi__.
* Translate the anchor list __anchor-eng-nor.txt__ into sme (and fin?)
  (__Tomi__), and into smj (__Thomas__ or __Anders Urheim__) (and nno?
  __Trond__). Note that the format is "lang1 / lang2", and that the number of
  lines should be kept in order to make it possible to move from one language to
  the next.
* __Saara__ to install the aligner, everyone to read the documentation on
  Tuesday and Wednesday, and then we have a meeting on it later this week.
* Add the anchor list translations to cvs (__Trond__)
** add to cvs location: gt/common/src/anchor.txt
** "eng / nob / sme / smj / fin".
   word / ord* / sátni*, sáni* / sana*, sanoj*
*** contra mono: hard to align
*** contra bi: each lg twice
*** usage: for eng/nob alignment, use eng/nob, for nob/sme alignment, use
    nob/sme

Perhaps best to have all lgs in one list, and extract pairs via
{{cut -d"/" -f1,4}}.

!!!7. Linguistics

!!North Sámi

!Semantic feature system

TODO:
* decide on a semantic feature system for nouns (__Linda__).
* Work with semantically based sets (__Trond, Linda__)
* Return to the infrastructure issue (__Trond__)
* A full semantic encoding of the lexicon is a future project, outside the
  scope of both divvun and disamb, but the ground work for such a project will
  be laid now.

Further discussion and details in the [previous meeting
memo.|/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-20.html]

TODO (__Trond__):
# Discussion testing
# infrastructure
# semiautomatic retagging

!!Lule Sámi

TODO:
* add the rest of the inc- words (__Thomas__)
**nothing done this week
* name morphology (__Thomas__)
**handed Tomi list
* translate Northern Sámi lists and sets to Lule Sámi
** __Linda, Trond__, with help from mother tongue speakers (__Thomas__, others).
   Work in progress.

!!!8. Name lexicon infrastructure

!!Complex names

TODO:
* Move xml2lexc complex name issue to bugzilla (__Børre__)
** Done!

!!Editing

TODO on eXist as editor:
# refactor and prepare risten.no for multiple collections:
## develop the Cocoon sitemap to delegate requests to the proper folder level,
   such that the most specific code is always used (__Sjur__)
### done for XQueries and XSLT; only CSS left (needs to be handled differently)
## refactor the code into more and more specific components according to our
   folder hierarchy (__Tomi, Sjur__)
# develop the needed XQueries and interface (__Sjur, Tomi__)
# data synchronisation between risten.no and the cvs repo (__Tomi__)
## nothing last week
# test and review when ready

!Data synchronisation task list/specification:

Details in the [previous meeting
memo.|/admin/weekly/2006/Meeting_2006-03-20.html]

!!!9. Spellers

Nothing until the new proper noun lexicon is in place.

!!!10. Other

!!Divvun admin

The project manager would like all Divvun project
members not working in the SD buildings to write down all hours worked, and a
very brief description of the tasks done. The list should be sent __Sjur__
every week on Friday afternoon as you leave work, or the following Monday
morning.

Making such lists is necessary to be able to document to the SD administration
that we are working the hours we should, in case of inquiries or newspaper
stories. I trust (and know) you do, but that is not enough if somebody external
doesn't. Those working in the SD buildings are using a time clock for the
same purposes, which at the same time enforces a stricter working-hour regime
than what is possible with our self-reporting system.

I have been doing the same thing for myself for a long time, and the benefit is
that it is easy to keep track of extra hours and "avspasering". There are many
applications out there that will help you, or you can just make a simple list on
your own.

TODO:
* keep a list of worked hours (__all Divvun team members__)
* start this week, then every week

!!Divvun project management while Sjur is on paternal leave

__Sjur__ will soon go on paternal leave (expected April 6), and most likely be
away for two weeks. While he is away, somebody else would need to be heading the
Divvun project. The basic tasks are pretty simple for the most part:

TODO:
* set up Monday meetings
* conduct the meeting (or let __Trond__ do it:-)
* finalize the meeting memo afterwords, making sure all tasks discussed have
  been properly added to the task list of the relevant persons
* also add the meeting memo template for the next meeting, so that people can
  update their tasks as they complete/work on them
* be the main contact person for Finnut Consult AS, and
  if there are any requests for information to make an offer for the Divvun
  project, delegate that question to the most appropriate one, and return the
  answer to Finnut

__Børre__ is temp. Project Manager:-)

!!Easter vacation/absenses

||  Who?    || When?
| __Børre__ | from the 10th to the 12th of April
| __Saara__ | at work normally
| __Sjur__  | no vacation, possibly paternal leave
| __Thomas__| from the 10th to the 12th of April, 3 days
| __Tomi__  | from the 10th to the 12th of April, might be at work offline
| __Trond__ | don't know yet

!!Gobby

TODO:
* install and test it, to prepare for cooperation with non-Mac users (use case:
  Lars Nygård in Oslo) (__Børre, Tomi, Trond__, if it works ok then also the
  others)

!!SubEthaEdit update

SEE 2.3 is released. It is now commercial only, but 2.2 is still available for
free, non-commercial use. Since we already have licenses, this is a non-issue,
and all should upgrade. The new version contains bug fixes, and a few new
features (don't remember them all, mostly improvements in the UI).

__Sjur__: I have made a simple, but useful jspwiki mode, for syntax coloring of
our meeting memos:-) It isn't completely reliable yet, improvements welcome (I
won't do anything more on it).

__Sjur__: I have also made a first attempt at an XQuery mode, but that one isn't
working very well. I'll give it to interested people, though:-)

TODO:
* upgrade [SEE|http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethatedit/] (__all__)
* install jspwiki mode from __Sjur__ (__all interested__)
