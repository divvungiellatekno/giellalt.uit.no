   Missing now is more parallel texts, and I have spent some time finding nob
   texts for our sme texts, with limited success so far.
* block out the CG rule(s) that remove(s) the Der readings using M4
    - Also this issue has been passed on to the programmers, as the pseudocode is
   already written.
* [fix bugs!](http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla).

# 3. Documentation

TODO:
* finish i18n work by adding a list of available language versions to each

   and whatever other processes and tasks needed to set up a corpus account.
* add the new *Words* section to the site

# 4. Corpus gathering

**Børre** contacted several authors:
* Jovnna Ánde Vest
* Stig Gælok
* Aage Solbakk

**Børre** will meet **Stig Gælok** today, he has a lot of texts in Lule Sámi.

**Bård Eriksen** was concerned that it would be too much work for them to
deliver texts to us. **Børre** has asked for their book catalog, to be able to
contact the authors directly.

**TODO:**
* contact NSI (**Børre**)
    - not yet
* contact authors (**Børre**, eventually **Lene**)
    - done, see above; no discussions with **Lene**
* evaluate an agreement with **Bård Eriksen** helping us collecting `smj`
  texts (**Børre** and **Sjur**)
    - discussed with him

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## General

Our way of dealing with the conversion of input documents has now reached an
advanced level. At some point we might consider to publish our results, to the
benefit of the rest of the research community.

JPedal work: **Tomi** went through the source code and added an option that
defines where the result goes. Didn't solve other issue with tagging.

**TODO:**
* remove headers and footers in the PDF conversion (**Saara**)
    - still needs some work
* Go through the java issues of JPedal (**Saara, Tomi**)
    - isn't quite delivering what we hoped, will need more work

## User accounts and access

For details, see a [previous meeting memo](Meeting_2006-06-19), as well as the
memo from a [dedicated
meeting|/infra/corpus_policy.html].

### Shell access

TODO:
* export to `/opt` (with cron) tools that the project team members find in 
  their cvs tree (the bound users do not have a cvs tree, and therefore need 
  these tools in `/opt` in order to conduct linguistic analyses) (**Tomi**)
    - Decision:
        - compiled transducers to `/opt` also in the future
        - scripts etc to `/usr/local/share/bin/`
* make shell script wrappers for the most common commands for user friendliness
  (we must think of what commands they are) (**Trond**)
    - (first version of first script, teaksta.sh, was checked in, but it is still
   not working (the problem is a simple handling of input-output, some shell
   script literates should have a look at it)
* write user account form, probably ask for copy of existing ones from the IT
  centre (**Trond** and **Sjur**)
* possibly deploy the user account form as an HTML form (**Børre**)
* write documentation for our `bound` users, with pointers to the ordinary 
  documentation (**Børre, Trond**)
* write documentation for how to apply for a user account (where's the form, to
  whom do I send the form, who needs it, etc.) (**Børre**)
* make our own guidelines for the user application processing (**Børre**)
* make a test user (**Børre**)
* test corpus access as test user (**Trond**)

### Web browser access

Has been discussed with Oslo. They will release a new version of the web
interface in a couple of weeks. Further discussions delayed till then.

## More texts to the graphical corpus interface:

TODO:
* add text to the server (**Lars**)

## Aligner

There has been a bug in the Bergen aligner, we will get a new (graphical)
version shortly, and wait for that. When it arrives, we will do some conversion, 
still waiting for the command-line version, though. The second obstacle is the
paucity of nob and fin text to parallel the sme ones.

TODO:
* use the present aligner to generate some initial input for Oslo to test.
  (**Trond** and **Saara**)
* gather parallel texts (**Trond**)

## Language recognition

New `.wm` files heve been made, with better performance. Saara, Ilona and
Trond have been testing and refining the software. There still is some room for
improvement. We now have a limit of 0 characters for paragraphs.

TODO:
* Get more text of the poorly covered languages: `sma, smj` (**Trond, Børre**)
    - `sma:` get the Bible texts (**Trond**)
* study the mistakes our recogniser makes today (**Trond**, **Ilona**)
* what about paragraphs with mixed content? Build a corpus of such paragraphs
  (**Trond**)

# 6. Infrastructure

## Xerox tools wrapped as servers

Feature request:
* option for XML output from server

**TODO:**
* improve and finish the present prototype (**Saara**)
    - done some, still more work to do

## Hyphenator

**Sjur** got help from **Saara** to sketch a Perl solution to the overgeneration 
problem and a clean-up script is in the works. Will be ready this week.

TODO:
* finish the hyphenator clean-up script (**Sjur**)
* Update the sma hyphenator rule set with the insights gained from smj updates
  (**Trond** during weekends)

## Automatic Bugzilla reminder for untouched bugs

TODO:
* give mail reminders a second try; ask Thor-Øivind for help if needed
  (**Børre**)
    - At last I found a solution. Will implement it today!

## M4

**TODO:**
* make speller make targets that utilise M4 to produce normative
  and hyphenation transducers; also disamb variants (see next) (**Tomi**)

# 7. Linguistics

## Derivation and spellers like Aspell

* revert the CG rule that preferres lexicalised forms over derivations with M4
  (**Trond** wrote the M4 pseudocode, **M4-literates** to translate).
  In the beginning of sme-dis.rle there is an explanation of the pseudocode.
  Just search for the rules as explained there.
* find and study all derived verbs in our corpus (**Thomas**)
* suggest which derivations could be generated (**Thomas**)
* lexicalise the rest (**Thomas**)

## Semantic double-tagging of names

Waiting for the name conversion to take place before the disamb rules can be
written. Further discussion delayed till then.

## North Sámi

Nothing this week?

## Lule Sámi

TODO:
* refine smj proper noun lexica, cf. the propernoun-smj-lex.txt
  (**Thomas, Trond**) 
* Schedule a T-T meeting this week - Wednesday.

# 8. Name lexicon infrastructure

Decided in Tromsø:
* add logging facilities to the interface
* add option to download local copies of the lexicon files directly from the db
* batch editing (change all entries in the found set), should later be enhanced
  to allow selection of exceptions (the found set minus deselected items)
* tag for excluding/including a name from certain applications
* future epxansion: choose what info to display in the single language browser
* display existing language entries when adding a new language to a record
* add editor to change single, existing entries

Details can be found in [the meeting
memo.|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]

TODO:
* finish refactoring for multiple collections in the search interfarce
  (**Sjur**)
    - worked on a specification (in the new CVSROOT/words/ section)
* develop the needed XQueries and UI (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* data synchronisation between risten.no and the cvs repo (**Tomi**)
    - discussion started on eXist-list, nothing useful came up. We need to
   reformulate the question from our perspective, and bring it up again
   (**Sjur**)
* add eXist and the proper noun interface to the G5 using Tomcat
  (**Sjur and Børre**)

# 9. Tromsø meeting follow-up

TODO:
* speller development - see the [meeting
  memo|/admin/physical_meetings/tromso-2006-08-lexc2xspell.html]. Separate
  follow-up next week.
* Lule Sámi linguist (**Sjur**)

## Speller data generation

We need to convert our Xerox lexicons to the format required by Polderland,
Aspell, etc. The basic architecture for the conversion was decided upon in
Tromsø, but it now needs to be implemented.

**TODO:**
* start to plan the implementation of the speller data conversion/generation
  (**Tomi**)

# 10. Other

## Bug fixing

**64** open Divvun/Disamb bugs (two down!), and **25** risten.no bugs

Guess: 1/3 of the bugs are fixed already (?)

## Meetings and Marratech

**TODO:**
* download and install newest Marratech
  (**Maaren**)
* we need instructions on how to use it, and test it (**Sjur**)

## Task lists as iCal entries

TODO:
* update Maaren's and Saara's installations to r430284 (**Børre**)

# 11. Next meeting, closing
