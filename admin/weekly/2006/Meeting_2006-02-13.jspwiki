!!!3. Documentation

!!Reviews

XSLT processing part of the corpus infra review is finished. The code is
finished and ready to use, but language identification still needs improvements.

!!!4. Corpus gathering

!!Collecting

See a [previous meeting memo|Meeting_2006-01-16] for what's to be done.

TODO: Send out the rest of the letters (__Børre__)

Since last meeting:

* Min Áigi
* called Anders Kintel - will sign it as soon as he gets the contract; will also
  burn on a CD
* Swedish Sámi Parliament: Grundström will be finished by summer time, now
  proofreading

Next:
* calling Olavi Korhonen, his dictionary is now in for printing
* then continuing on the list of orgs/persons to contact

!!Odin

Waiting for __Sæth__ to discuss with colleagues about how to implement the
cooperation, and return to us.

TODO:
* call Sæth (__Børre__)

!!Bible texts

TODO:
* review paratext2xml converter (__Børre__)
* convert smj NT to paratext. (__Børre__)
* ask to get fin and swe NT and OT in paratext format. (__Trond__)

!!!5. Corpus infrastructure

We need more "version control" in the corpus work - we don't know which version
of the XSL script was used (but roughly whether it was used or not). We need to
document within the XSL file which version of ''all'' tools were used, including
the XSL file (common section/template) itself.

Transferring the old gt/sme/corp files to the new corpus repo:
* for the biggest top ten (or so) the orig. should be located and copied to the
  new corpus repo
* then these files should be removed from gt/sme/corp/
* all small files could just be forgotten/ignored

Task list:
# Include the xsl files under version control
## RCS version control is almost finished, but an issue with access control is
   still open.
### Access control resolved through Unix groups: one group for corpus
    maintainers with write access, and another for corpus users, with read-only
    access.
# Improve Finnish language detection as part of the corpus processing
## Move to Bugzilla (__Saara__)
# Review automatic hyphen:
## Acceptable results: 90% of all real hyphens correctly tagged.
### Move to Bugzilla (__Saara__)

Further discussion about corpus analysis and computer use:

* the new G5 is tremendeously faster than cochise, thus we want to use it
* cochise will continue to be our main corpus repo
* the corpus/gt/ dir will be synchronised with the G5
* corpus analysis and usage will happen on the G5
* we need to develop strong enough security routines for the G5 to fulfill our
  obligations towards the text licensers
* we are still using only one processor when analysing - making some simple
  multiprocessor analysis script will increase the speed of the analysis a lot

!!!6. Linguistics

Anything? Nothing.

!!!7. Name lexicon infrastructure

!!Complex names

TODO:
* make sure xml2lexc can handle complex names in ways compatible with our
  present tool chain (=reconstruct the lexc format we have now) (__Tomi__)
** the resulting file format should be identical to our present prop-name
   file (=lexc), that can then be converted to our new xml format using the same
   script as for the regular names (__Tomi__ or __Saara__, but only when the
   technical details are settled)
* __Saara__ has added the analyzer as part
  of the preprocess, but it is slow, and needs to be optimized.

Move these issues to bugzilla (__Børre__)

! Preprocessor optimization

To optimize one could build a targeted transducer only containing the relevant
lexicons for preprocessing. But presently that leads to the following lexicons
being reported as referenced but undefined:

* (Punctuation)
* (Abbreviation)
* (Acronym)
* (Adposition)
* (Negativeverb)
* (Copula)
* (VerbRoot)
* (AdjectiveRoot)
* (At)
* (NounSecond)
* (ALIT)
* (NAMAT)
* (SAS)

Perhaps picking the

{{{
hum-tf4-ans142:~/gt/sme/src trond$ grep '% ' adv-sme-lex.txt 
earret% eará adv ;
dan% dihte adv ;
...
}}}

TODO:
# make a  lexc Root lexicon (first 40 lines of sme-lex.txt)
# extract the relevant parts of the relevant lexica from the main transducer
# built from the union of a and b.

Discussion will continue on the newsgroup.

!!XML format

TODO:
# testing of conversion
# eXist as editor:
## develop the needed XQueries and interface
## data synchronisation between risten.no and 
## test whether eXist as editor is actually working well

!!!8. Other
