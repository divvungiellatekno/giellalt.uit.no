!!!3. Documentation - divvun.no

Deadline 22.6.

Børre will be the main responsible for getting it all in place till the deadline.

Things required before the opening:
# Press release text, conforming to what we actually release (in 3 languages? More?)
## No text yet - Børre will write something based on risten.no PR in the car, and check
   it in when online again (in the evening)
# divvun.no front pages up and running, with a nice look and interlinking in place, as
  site-generated pages.
## Almost there
## The howto tab is not working as intended. Wednesday fix: Remove the howto tab, and then fix
   it later.
# front page and general info in all languages
## Almost done. sme version of background-sma missing.
# general outline of the project, with deliveries and main timetable
## Done
# giellatekno.uit.no front pages up and running, with a nice look and interlinking in
  place, as site-generated pages.
## No-go
# The actual content of the documentation, our common child, should be gone through with
  the forthcoming public release in mind.
## Some done - ok

Requirements for the opening:
* i18n in place? What if we can't get it to work? Subtabs for each language. The submenus
  must follow the language of the subtabs.
** Subtabs
* frontpage contains the points outlined at the last meeting. Cf. this list:
** Information in 5 languages (sme, smj, nob, fin, eng)
*** Done
** Size of general public info: only a few paragraphs. It should include:
*** what the divvun project is
*** why it is made, by whom, on whose decision
*** organization (project board, part of GIO, with UiT, what else?)
*** how, when, and for whom it eventually will be used, and on what terms and price
*** what we make
*** why we do not make sma (background on separate page, in nob and sme)
*** timetable (separate page, all langs.)
*** how we make it (separate page, all langs)
*** an explanation of our lg policy (separate page, all)
*** a good set of links, incl our own newsfeed (RSS)

The separate pages:

!!Authoring

*** Thomas to translate the rest

* how we make it: Børre x5

!!Translations
The files will be written in nob, and made available via cvs, in xtdocs/sd/.../xdocs/
* eng: Sjur, others?
* sme: Børre (Maaren proofreads)
* smj: Thomas, proofread by e.g. Kåre Tjikkom
* fin: Maaren

!!Files

Børre will make document stubs in the correct places, with the correct filenames.
__Today! (right after the meeting:-)__.

!!!4. Corpus gathering

The translator gave in. The text should be translated from Finnish to Norwegian. The task is
given to Trond, Maaren will send over the Finnish text, these versions will be added to the adm
catalogue of the documentation.

!!!5. Corpus infrastructure

Language incl. in place - default = sme. An improvement would be to have sme default when
listing text from the sme catalogue and smj when from smj, etc. Tomi will look into it.

!!!6. Linguistics

There is work underway on Lule Sámi.

!!!7. Term db / risten.no

More bug fixing, updates. Lule Sámi interface in place on the dev computer, South Sámi
coming today.

!!!8. Other issues

!!Language(s) of RSS Newsfeed

Forrest can generate RSS news for us, which we will use to broadcast project events. What
should the language be? What should the content be, ie the type of events that we publish this way?

* Language
** If monolingual: nob or sme? If multilingual
*** sme for linguistic issues, sme and nob for other issues
* Content Type
** Major updates to the docs
** test releases (Alpha, Beta, etc.)
** ...

To be decided by tomorrow. We (Børre/Sjur) need to find out what is possible in Forrest.
