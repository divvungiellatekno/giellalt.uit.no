!!!3. Documentation

Documentation tasks:

Add documentation on our corpus infrastructure and our corpus work in general
(__Børre__, __Tomi__, __Trond__, __Saara__):
* The directory structure is now settled (as of last meeting), and should be 
  documented.

For the basic corpora, we need 2 additional types of documentation, or doc for 2 target
groups:

# For the __users/linguists:__ What corpus are found, how do I use them (this
  info is now scattered) 
  (Part of the HOTWO USE is documented in the catxml docu
  The what documents are found where etc + an overall documentation is not
  written, since the corpus is so sparsely populated)
# For the __collectors:__ How do I add texts, where do I add them, how do I
  convert them (this is (partly?) done in the Corpus Conversion document)

test:

* add/update Aspell documentation (__Tomi__)
** Some documentation has been written, but there still is work to be done.
* as always: document what you're doing:-) (__all__)

!!Divvun.no down again

Tomcat is running out of memory in between. __Børre__ will look into changing
to Forrest generating static html pages (forrest site), and serve those off of
the standard Apache server. He will also look at utilizing Forrestbot as the
tool to update the site, instead of our homegrown script.

Update: Only one small change needed in our own script. Binary download section
should be included.

!!!4. Corpus gathering

Governmental documents (earlier in pdf, now in html)

Børre has gathered files from the Sámediggi
Will go on gathering files from [Odin|http://odin.dep.no/].

!!Contracts

__Sjur__ had a meeting with Kimmo Koskenniemi, resolving all the issues that he
had with it. Trond and __Sjur__ has also discussed these, changed them a little
bit. The contracts are ready to be sent to the lawyer (who sadly is ill).

!!!5. Corpus infrastructure

* Problems with convert2xml.pl?
** Barfs up at line 91
** Add issue to Bugzilla (always when you find problems!)

{{{
Quoting from the convert2xml.pl file:
    26  my $xsl_file = ''; 
    27  my $dir = '';
    28  my $log_dir = ''; 
    90  my $log_file = $log_dir . "/" . $file . ".log";
    91  open STDERR, '>>', "$log_file" or die "Can't redirect STDERR: $!";
}}}

Problem analysed and will be corrected (__Tomi__)

Updated task list:
# Make a system for file and directory permission (today: we all belong to the 
  cvs group), to only allow people with root user privileges write access to the
  corpus repository, at least regarding original files (__Børre__)
## __Done__
# Include the xsl files under version control (__Børre, Tomi, Saara__)
# Incorporate language detection as part of the corpus processing (__Tomi__)
# we need a way to deal with hyphenated documents (documents with (manually) inserted
  hyphenation marks) in catxml/preprocess.
  (__Tomi, Børre,__ (discussion in the newsgroup:) __Sjur, Trond, Saara__)
## Discuss details in the newsgroup
## in normal cases hyphenation points should be removed
## when testing the robustness of our parsers, as well as when testing the
   hyphenator, the hyphenation points should be retained

!! Corpus dtd issue

To summarize (taken from Saara's newsgroup posting of Fri, 11 Nov 2005:

* Change the person name to firstname and lastname. Agreed/decided.
* Add an element collection:

{{{
<!ELEMENT collection (#PCDATA) >
}}}

* Agreed.
* Leave the element translator as it is now (easier to read that way and
  avoid the changes).
* Add element conserning the completeness of the metadata. I guess the
  uncompleteness here means that some information that should be added is
  missing. (This info would be for our internal use.)

{{{
<!ELEMENT metadata (complete|incomplete)>
<!ELEMENT complete EMPTY>
<!ELEMENT incomplete EMPTY>
}}}

* Element for the word count (this is used when counting e.g. the frequencies
  of some form etc.). Filling this slot should be part of the standard xsl, then.
  

<!ELEMENT wordcount #PCDATA>

* Add an element for the license type. See the bug:
* [license type bug|http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=207]

Saara's suggestion:

{{{
<!ELEMENT availability (free|license)
<!ELEMENT free EMPTY>
<!ELEMENT license EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST license
	type (type1|type2|..) #REQUIRED
 >
}}}

__Saara__ will update the dtd.

!!!6. Linguistics

!!Name lexicon

Summary: see the [newsgroup|news:di5mbi$26ad$1@news.uit.no]

The plan for this project was as follows: Two lines of work run in parallel:

# name markup
# testing of conversion

When these two tasks are done (at some point in the future), the conversion will
be done.

Status quo on the two lines of work:

The mark up of the remaining 400 entries until conversion starts (People
allocated look at the rest: __Maaren, Ilona, Trond, Børre__). This week's status
quo is as follows (some 400 names not assigned):

{{{
 323 NYSTØ
  32 BERN
  20 LONDON
  18 MARJA
  17 NIILLAS
  12 ACCRA
   5 HEANDARAT
   4 ANAR
   2 ALEUHTAT
}}}

The technical issues (specified in earlier memos: Conducted by:
__Tomi, Saara, Sjur__. __Sjur__ and __Tomi__ will tomorrow Tuesday report back
on a plan for using risten.no as editor for our name lexicon

A very short example is found at common/src/proper-nouns.xml.
Saara has made a conversion script which is ready to use. More discussions on
the layout of the resulting xml file is needed.

!!Complex names

In the present lexicon, complex names are treated as a class of first parts (see
below), and the last part is stored as a regular simplex name.

With the new XML lexicon format, the complex names should be restored. The
present lexicon format can easily be reconstructed (by splitting at the
space character), and the list of complex names can also be used for other
purposes in the future.

Also, integration with risten.no and the kvensk project (and through that, also
Kartverket in one way or another), presupposes that we can store the complete
and "true" name.

There are ~100 first parts of complex names, the name lexicon contained 739 
such complex names before they were broken up in 2004/10/14.

First-part tags are now listed separately:

{{{
LEXICON ProperNounFirstPart
El% Baradej BERN-sur ;
 FirstTag ;
Badje FirstTag ;
Bajimus FirstTag ;
Bajit FirstTag ;
Bassi FirstTag ;
}}}

The format we left a year ago looked like this:

{{{
Aleksander% I%:a% suo0lu:Aleksander% I%:a% suollu SUOLU ;
Amerihká% Ovttastuvvan% Stáhtat:Amerihká% Ovttastuvvan% Stáhta ALEUHTAT ;
Amery% jiekn1arav0da:Amery% jiekn1arav'da DEATNU ;
Amundsena-Scotta% stas1uvdna DEATNU ;
Austrália% Álppat:Austrália% Ál'pa ALEUHTAT ;
Badje% Riebejoh0ka:Badje% Riebejoh'ka DEATNU ;
Badje% Stuorjoh0ka:Badje% Stuorjoh'ka DEATNU ;
Bajimus% Fielvuonjáv0ri:Bajimus% Fielvuonjáv'ri DEATNU ;
Bajimus% Molles1jáv0ri:Bajimus% Molles1jáv'ri DEATNU ;
}}}

They were broken up with the following argumentation:

{{{
revision 1.127
date: 2004/10/14 09:38:17;  author: trond;  state: Exp;  lines: +4653 -5153
This is the great % removal revision. The background was that our
pre-composed multiword names, such as Davimus Borsejoh0ka, etc. did
not work. They passed the preprocessor only in the nominative, and not
in other cases. In the worst case, their parts were not recognised as
such, and the result would be a missing analysis. Now, the first part
has been assigned to a separate lexicon, ProperNounFirstPart, that get
the tag +N+Prop+Attr only. This lexicon contains entries like Davimus,
Guhkes, Helse, magnehtalas1, and other first parts of complex
names. These should be disambiguated in sme-dis.rle, leaving the tag
only when there is a N Prop following it. As a result of this, the
file bin/attr.txt is drastically reduced.
}}}

Task list for this issue:

* restore complex names from old cvs; c/sh-ould be stored in a separate file
**  cvs up -r 1.126 sme/src/propernoun-sme-lex.txt (__Trond__)
**  grep % propernoun-sme-lex.txt | iconv -f L1 -t UTF-8 | less (__Trond__)
** Make a file complex-names-lex.txt in gt/common/src/complex-proper-nouns.txt
   (__Trond__)
* find eventual unique second-parts (B-parts of names that do not exist in
  isolation)
* remove these B-parts from the ordinary name file (__Tomi__)
* the resulting file format should be identical to our present prop-name
  file (=lexc), that can then be converted to our new xml format using the same
  script as for the regular names
* make sure xml2lexc can handle complex names in ways compatible with our
  present tool chain (=reconstruct the lexc format we have now)

Example of how the old lexicon can be used to identify complex name last parts
that are also used as simple names:

{{{
$grep Riebejo gt/sme/src/propernoun-sme-lex.txt 
Badje% Riebejoh0ka:Badje% Riebejoh'ka DEATNU ;
Riebejoh0ka:Riebejoh'ka DEATNU ;
}}}

The details of the new XML format needs to be further discussed in the newsgroup
and integrated with the rest of the XML work and discussion.

!!North Sámi

* three-part compounds issue still open
** look at Lule Sámi, but apply it to second-parts only
** Thomas is working on it
** the exact rules for when shortening happens should be documented (__Maaren__
   will send the normativity decisions to __Thomas__)
** descriptive facts from our corpus (__Trond, Thomas__)
** linguistic analysis/discussion to continue in the newsgroup
* number project still open

* diphthong simplification/G3 issue should be carried over from Lule Sámi

!!Lule Sámi

 __Sjur, Thomas__ and __Trond__ will cont. Lule Sámi issues.

Tasks:
* update the normativity issues document:
** Px issue
* G3 open issues (S2, some S3, S5, S6 and S7; Sx = Spiik, consonant series)
**  Great progress has been made on the G3 issue, just some minor points remain.

!!Numerals

The issue awaits closure of the propernames project, and is postponed to next week.

!!Árran meeting

__Børre, Anne Britt__ and __Sjur__ go to Árran on Wednesday, for meetings on
Thursday. Main meeting is with __Anders Kintel__ about using his Lule Sámi
dictionary in our projects.

!!!7. Speller infrastructure

Nothing this week either.

!!!8. Other

!!Technical issues

* The mac os / perl bug (at least __Trond__ and __Sjur__ has it):
** utf8 "\xC4" does not map to Unicode at /Users/trond/gt/script/preprocess line
   82. This msg did not show up in 10.3 (perl 5.8.1), but does so in 10.4 (perl
   5.8.6). It is probably a perl - OS mismatch. (__Trond__, __Thor Øivind__,
   __Tomi__)
*** Another __example__ of the same bug:
*** :"\x{00c3}" does not map to utf8 at ../script/preprocess line 113, <> chunk
    33.
*** One way to "resolve" this is to redirect the error messages to /dev/null:
{{{
... | preprocess 2> /dev/null | lookup ...
}}}

!!XXE updates

Who has the latest XXE (3.0) and the latest forrest config?

* Børre - ok
* Trond - ok
* Maaren - XXE, but no config
* Tomi - no
* Thomas - no
* Saara - ok
* Sjur - ok
* Ilona - ok?
* Linda - no

__Børre__ is updating the ones not yet up to speed.

!!Video conferencing across firewalls

The problem we've had with the SD firewall persists, and there doesn't seem to
be any resources available to help us. __Geir Kaaby__ instead suggested we look
at the [Marratech|http://www.marratech.com/] package, and try it out. So please
download the MacOS X client (or get it from me), and I'll send you the URL to
the meeting room as soon as I get it.

!!Bug fixing

__24__ open bugs (and 23 risten.no bugs)

!Bugzilla update
When Bugzilla is being moved, it should also be updated to the newest version,
and the UTF-8 bug should be resolved.

!!risten.no

* Organisation: could __Tomi__ be used, in exchange for more linguistic work by
  (old) GIO members? Yes, it is ok, but how much still needs to be evaluated
* it is ok to integrate "kvensk" placenames with risten.no
** this should be integrated with the general proper name work - we want all
   proper names integrated with risten.no, df above
** needs further development of risten.no to allow for multiple XML bases to
   be presented and maintained in parallel. This is to be further worked on by
   __Tomi__ and __Sjur__
