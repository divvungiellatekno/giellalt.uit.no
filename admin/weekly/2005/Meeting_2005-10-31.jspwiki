!!!3. Documentation

Documentation tasks:

# Add documentation on our corpus infrastructure and our corpus work in general
  ("To be done by the ones making the corpora": __Børre__, __Tomi__, __Trond__,
  __Saara__).
# Now  we have 4 documents:
## Correct corpus (disamb usage)
## Corpus plan (for the disamb corpus cwb)
## catxml

For the basic corpora, we need 3 types of documentation, or doc for 3 target
groups:

# For the __users/linguists:__ What corpus are found, how do I use them (this
  info is now scattered)
# For the __collectors:__ How do I add texts, where do I add them, how do I
  convert them (this is the Corpus conversion doc)
# For the __programmer:__ What did I actually do? (this is partly the catxml doc)

For the work on the graphical user interface, we need documentation as well, in
principle along the same lines, except that the user is not the same linguist
as above.

* add/update Aspell documentation (__Tomi__)
** Some documentation has been written, but there still is work to be done.
* as always: document what you're doing:-) (__all__)

!!!4. Corpus gathering

Governmental documents (earlier in pdf, now in html)

Tasks:
* move existing gov. documents (pdf) from gt/ to our corpus repository (Børre)
** There are appr. 10 non-broken pdf documents in gt/sme/corp/original/ 
   (the ones named stmelXXX.pdf contain only one page each)
* Collect public (pdf and html) files (Børre)
**  Done some test downloading, will have to look at tools to do this 
    automatically.

!!Contracts

Tasks:
* Follow-up on the lawyers' comments (__Trond__ has started with the university)
** __Trond__ and __Sjur__ finished the next revision of the contracts, and are
   waiting for comments from __Kimmo Koskenniemi__
*** Update: No comments from __Kimmo__ yet
* add a background document explaining the model (__Sjur__)

The most problematic issue:

Who has the copyright of extracted material, like single words, collections of
words, syntactic structure (potentially with some words filled in)? We need
this to be controlled by us, not by the authors. The exact borderline is hard
to define.

!!North Sámi New Testament

Our inhouse sme nt is as new as the one they have at Bibelselskapet, and we
were told we could just use the version we have ourselves.

!!Lule Sámi New Testament

Svenska Bibelsällskapet is putting their finishing touches to the Lule Sámi
translation, we will have it soon.

* Haven´t heard anything from Olavi Korhonen. The only problem with our version
  is that there are some run together strings, and we could solve it ourselves.

!!Lule Sámi Dictionary

Nothing new about the meeting with __Anders Kintel__.

!!!5. Corpus infrastructure

Updated task list:
# Make a system for file and directory permission (today: we all belong to the 
  cvs group), to only allow people with root user privileges write access to the
  corpus repository, at least regarding original files
# Include the xsl files under version control (cvs? rcs?)  
# Incorporate language detection as part of the corpus processing.
# we need a way to deal with hyphenated documents in catxml/preprocess:
## in normal cases hyphenation points should be removed
## when testing the robustness of our parsers, as well as when testing the
   hyphenator, the hyphenation points should be retained

!!!6. Linguistics

!!Name lexicon

Summary: see the [newsgroup|news:di5mbi$26ad$1@news.uit.no]

Motivation:

* __Divvun:__ We want to cross-link different versions of the same locations
 in different languages
* __Common:__ We do not want to enter the same names twice. We want a
 language-independent name lexicon
* __Disamb:__ Having a richer tag set makes it easier to disambiguate
* __Future:__ Richer analysis makes new applications possible, within
 information retrieval, grammar checking, machine translation etc.

Needed: A plan for this project:

# do the main markup in the present propernoun file
# make a script for converting it to xml (to be done one time)
# make a script for xml2lexc (to be done by the makefile)
## There is a sample file for the xml file format in gt/common/src/proper-nouns.xml
## There is a working xml2lexc for Komi, written by Saara
# make the tags etc. in the parser

Conversion:

# Mark up the remaining 6090 entires until conversion starts (__Maaren__ to do
  the Sámi names, __Ilona__ to look at C-FI-NEN and other Finnish names,
  __Trond, Thomas__ and __Børre__ to look at the rest)
# Entries still to be done: see above
# This means we would need a seventh option, the unspecified name.
# Then split propernoun-sme-lex.txt into two, one with the sami name being
  generated by the xml2lexc script, and one manually written file, containing
  the name sublexica (called propernoun-sme-morph.txt or whatever)   
# Look into efficient editing of the XML lexicon (__Tomi, Saara__)
# Then convert to xml (__Tomi, Saara__)
# Look into efficient editing of the XML lexicon again (__Tomi, Saara__)
# Look into synchronisation issues with risten.no - we want the names there
  as well (__Tomi__)
## Consider automatic sorting on commit

!! Twol SETS definition issue

The definition of G1, G2, G3 in Lule Sámi is still open. and we would like to
have input on this issue. We need a G3 definition for North Sámi also.

Update: it is still not working, see [bug
193|http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=193]

SUGGESTION (__Trond__): __Thomas__, __Trond__ and __Sjur__ didn't meet last week
either and should try again this Wednesday instead.

!!North Sámi

* three-part compounds issue still open
* number project still open
* The treatment of Sámi place names, we need a contract with "Norge digitalt",
  via UFD.
** __Sjur__ has written an e-mail to the UFD contact person,
   __Øystein Johannessen,__ who will look into it soon. He has not responded
   beyond saying he will return to it. __Sjur__ brought this up in the board
   meeting, and __Bjørn Olav Megard__ will remind __Øystein Johannessen__
   about this issue. __Sjur__ will follow up on this one.
* normativity issues:
** the Giellalávdegoddi meeting was last Friday, they will have a new meeting in
   December. They were not able to make any decisions, and there will be a new
   Giellalávdegoddi beginning next year who won't make decisions until late
   spring. This is a serious problem for the Divvun problem.
*** Actions: __Sjur__ will bring this to the Divvun board, write a new letter to
    the Giellalávdegoddi, emphasizing the needs and timetables of the project
** The [document with the list of open
   issues|/doc/lang/sme/normativity-issues.html]
   needs updating, both regarding the status of each issue, and documentation of
   them. Also a better classification of the issues would be nice.

!!Lule Sámi

 __Sjur__, __Thomas__ and __Trond__ will cont. Lule Sámi issues.

!!Numerals

* The issue is postponed to next week.

# An empirical overview
## Numeral generation
## Numeral inflection
## Numerals as parts of compounds
# A clear concept of how we want to treat them
## Tagging
# A treatment

We will return to this issue after the name conversion.

!!!7. Speller infrastructure

Nothing this week either.

!!!8. Other

!!Technical issues

* The mac os / perl bug (at least __Trond__ and __Sjur__ has it):
** utf8 "\xC4" does not map to Unicode at /Users/trond/gt/script/preprocess line
   82. This msg did not show up in 10.3 (perl 5.8.1), but does so in 10.4 (perl
   5.8.6). It is probably a perl - OS mismatch. (__Trond__, __Thor Øivind__,
   __Tomi__)
*** Another __example__ of the same bug:
*** :"\x{00c3}" does not map to utf8 at ../script/preprocess line 113, <> chunk
    33.
*** One way to "resolve" this is to redirect the error messages to /dev/null:
{{{
... | preprocess 2> /dev/null | lookup ...
}}}

!!Video conferencing across firewalls

The problem we've had with the SD firewall persists, and there doesn't seem to
be any resources available to help us. __Geir Kaaby__ instead suggested we look
at the [Marratech|http://www.marratech.com/] package, and try it out. So please
download the MacOS X client (or get it from me), and I'll send you the URL to
the meeting room as soon as I get it.

!!Bug fixing

__19__ open bugs (and 24 risten.no bugs)

!Bugzilla update
When Bugzilla is being moved, it should also be updated to the newest version,
and the UTF-8 bug should be resolved.

!!Buying

* rucksacks for the whole Divvun team

!!risten.no

* Organisation: could __Tomi__ be used, in exchange for more linguistic work by
  (old) GIO members? Yes, it is ok, but how much still needs to be evaluated
* it is ok to integrate "kvensk" placenames with risten.no
** this should be integrated with the general proper name work - we want all
   proper names integrated with risten.no, df above
** needs further development of risten.no to allow for multiple XML bases to
   be presented and maintained in parallel. This is to be further worked on by
   __Tomi__ and __Sjur__

!!Project planning and development processes

Trond is using his project as a test case for an IT guy, __Geir Tore Voktor__,
who is taking a course in project management. Be prepared to answer questions.

!! Conference report from Trond

* Relevant themes on the conference for us:
** Terminology work
** Dictionary work between minority languages
** Repositories for minority language resources
** Disambiguation work, for South African languages

* Also, our work is relevant to other projects. This 

* There is welsh work on terminology:
** (__Dewi Jones__, __Delyth Prys__, U Wales, Bangor, I couldn't find).
   They use ISO standards for terminological work, the ones of us interested in
   [risten.no|http://www.risten.no] should have a look.
