# 3. Documentation

Documentation tasks:

1. Add documentation on our corpus infrastructure and our corpus work in general
  ("To be done by the ones making the corpora": **Børre**, **Tomi**, **Trond**,
  **Saara**).
1. Now  we have 4 documents:
    1. Correct corpus (disamb usage)
    1. Corpus plan (for the disamb corpus cwb)
    1. Corpus conversion, two versions, in infra and in ling. Tomi and Børre have
    done parallell work ;-(
    1. catxml

For the basic corpora, we need 3 types of documentation, or doc for 3 target
groups:

1. For the users/linguists:
    1. What corpus are found, how do I use them (this info is now scattered)
1. For the collectors:
    1. How do I add texts, where do I add them, how do I convert them (this is the
   Corpus conversion doc)
1. For the programmer
    1. What did I actually do? (this is partly the catxml doc)

For the work on the graphical user interface, we need documentation as well, in
principle along the same lines, except that the user is not the same linguist
as above.

1. add/update Aspell documentation (**Tomi**)
1. finish divvun2web script (**Børre**)
    1.  the cronjob is up an working. It needs a better error reporting mechanism,
    though.
1. as always: document what you're doing:-) (**all**)

Crontab:

Do we need validation upon cvs check-in? What about forrestbot?
An xml validation check (acc to our dtd) is a good thing. We would like that
to be implemented.

We need better error reporting, and errors should preferably be caught before
cvs commit.

**Børre**:
* add cvs commit xml validation
* look into how divvun2web can provide (better) error messages, or look at
  forrestbot

# 4. Corpus gathering

See [notes from the 12.9. meeting](Meeting_2005-09-12.html#4.+Corpus+gathering)
for details about the steps forward.

## Contracts

Tasks:
* read through Trond's translations (**Børre**, **Sjur**)
    - Done, and commented
* e-mail Kimmo Koskenniemi about the missing fourth contract, and about
  unclear paragraphs in the versions received (**Sjur**).
    - Done
* contact lawyers (find suitable lawyers, **Trond** will start with the
  university)
* send the license text to lawyers
    -  These should be sent to the university lawyers, as the sámediggi ones
    are overloaded with work.
* add a background document explaining the model

The most problematic issue:

Who has the copyright of extracted material, like single words, collections of
words, syntactic structure (potentially with some words filled in)? We need
this to be controlled by us, not by the authors. The exact borderline is hard
to define.

We will send the contracts as is to the lawyers, in parallel with waiting for
comments from Kimmo. The SD lawyers will be glad to *not* get this task, as
they're overloaded as is. Trond will follow up on the issue.

## North Sámi New Testament

**Trond** has been in contact with Bibelselskapet, and sent the version he
received from a collegue, gathered from the web. Now we await a reaction from
Bibelselskapet.

## Lule Sámi New Testament

**Børre** has converted the translation (which was only available in pdf) to
rtf, and sent the files back to Bibelsällskapet for corrections.

Update (week 39): Olavi Korhonen had some problems with fonts in the document,
Børre helped him with that. We seem to have the final version now.

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

## Naming conventions and directory structure

See [notes from the 12.9.
meeting|Meeting_2005-09-12.html#Naming+conventions+and+directory+structure]
for details about the decision and implementation, as well as a list of tasks.

**Børre** has done some work, but it is only locally on his machine. Some more
discussions with **Trond** must be done before these are copied to cochise.

* Børre:
    - The three directory structure is too cumbersome, the only thing we need to
   have control of is the original file, the meta-info.xsl file and the version
   of the script making the final file.
    - We will have to have some build system (make, scons) to do the grunt work.
* Sjur
    - If everything but the orig directory is automatically created and renewed,
   then everything should be clean and fine, and the directories will only be
   implementation details.
    - This also requires some sort of build system, which Sjur had assumed

## Corpus conversion

### Pdf to XML

Extraction priority list
1. retain correct Sámi characters: ok
1. retain word and sentence order: ok
1. retain paragraph order: ok
1. retain structure
    1. paragraphs: ok, by perl
    1. titles, headers: ok, by perl
    1. metadata (author, year, etc.): ok, when it is present in the document
    1. lists: no
    1. tables: no

A Perl module for character conversions
*   **Saara** proposes a Perl module that handles the character coding
    issues. The pdf conversion faces the same problems with
    e.g. Latin-6 character codes are present in the doc
    to xml conversion as well, so a module would be a good idea. (I got
    the impression from the word2xml.pl script, that some problems
    with the characters still remain.) I try to make the module so
    general that it suits to html character conversions later on. What
    do you think?

Problems found so far using open-source tools:
* paragraphs are correctly ordered, but not separated (i.e. one long
paragraph): solved
* no structure: parsed afterwards

Tasks:
* **Børre** and **Saara** to discuss what perhaps is two different approaches
  to this,
* and evaluate differences and strengths.

### HTML to XML

* we already have some tools according to **Saara**
* this is anyway easy, as HTML provides us with the structure we need
* what is needed is a transformation to our XML, + adding the metadata as usual
* it can wait at least a week or two (after pdf conversion is mostly done)

# 6. Linguistics

## Name lexicon

See [notes from the 12.9. meeting](Meeting_2005-09-12.html#6.+Linguistics)

## Place name summary

**Sjur** needs a short resumé of the present status wrt the parallel place
names. The resumé will be given to the project board for information. This is
the situation:

* Finland: we have received all names, in North Sámi and Finnish. What
  about Inari and Skolt Sámi place names? **Børre** will find out what we
  received, and whether it contained Inari and Skolt Sámi. Today:-)
* Sweden: the transcription (from old to new orthogr.) is finished, now the
  names are identified as Sámi ones. Have we made it clear that we need parallel
  names (i.e. the Swedish (Finnish/Meänkieli) parallel as well? No. Can they
  deliver parallel names?
  We don't know (yet). **Thomas** will ask.
    - Lantmäteriet are now manually linking the parallel names: Due to lack of
   funds it takes time. Anette Torensjö doesn´t believe it´s finished until the
   beginning of next year.
* Norway: we have received all Sámi names, but the CD is unreadable (we have
  earlier received a partial list of all names in all Sámi languages, reflecting
  the status quo of the orthography conversion 3 years ago).
* We can not get any parallel listing directly from Statens kartverk,
  but **Øystein Johannessen** has promised to help us through Norge Digitalt.
  As of today, nothing new has been heard.

Conclusion: it has been much easier to get place names from Finland and Sweden
than anticipated, and so far without any costs on the project. So far, the
place names have been the single most important contribution from Finland
and Sweden for this project.

##  Twol SETS definition issue

Trond and Thomas tried to define Lule Sámi G1, G2, G3 sequences in the SETS
section of the twol file. It did not succeed, it turned out we had done it in
the xfst spirit. We would like to have input on this issue.

## North Sámi

* three-part compounds issue still open, as are the name and number projects.
    - **Trond, Maaren, Sjur** will look into this in Guovdageaidnu
* **Johnny Andersen** has written a letter to us on the treatment of Sámi place
  names, we need a contract with "Norge digitalt", via UFD. We will have to
  get such an agreement. This is a task for **Thomas** and **Trond**.
    - **Sjur** has written an e-mail to the UFD contact person,
   **Øystein Johannessen,** who will look into it soon.
* normativity issues:
    - the Giellalávdegoddi meeting is in October sometime

## Lule Sámi

* we need a lexicon
* compounding and derivation
    - **Thomas** has finished with deverbals, now working with denominals
    - most likely the same three-part compound problem in Lule Sámi as well
   (the middle stem shortens to a stem only found in such compounds)
    - it is possible that even the first stem shortens the same way
* Suffix boundary symbol has not been added, we are not sure whether we should
  do that.

## Numerals

1. An empirical overview
    1. Numeral generation
    1. Numeral inflection
    1. Numerals as parts of compounds
1. A clear concept of how we want to treat them
    1. Tagging
1. A treatment

# 7. Speller infrastructure

## Aspell

Write documentation here as well.

The munch-list is working, and the affix file is improving. See [15.8. meeting
memo|/admin/weekly/2005/Meeting_2005-08-15.html] for more.

Got an e-mail from **Roy Dragseth**, that he had to terminate the aspell
processes **Tomi** had left running on cochise after work, because they consumed
all the memory.

See [12.9. meeting memo](/admin/weekly/2005/Meeting_2005-09-12.html#Aspell) for
a list of open issues.

# 8. Other

## Technical issues

* The mac os / perl bug (at least **Trond** and **Sjur** has it):
    - utf8 "\xC4" does not map to Unicode at /Users/trond/gt/script/preprocess line
   82. This msg did not show up in 10.3 (perl 5.8.1), but does so in 10.4 (perl
   5.8.6). It is probably a perl - OS mismatch. (**Trond**, **Thor Øivind**,
   **Tomi**)
        - Another **example:**
        - :"\x{00c3}" does not map to utf8 at ../script/preprocess line 113, <> chunk
    33.

## Bug fixing

* 13 open bugs (and 24 risten.no bugs) - it seems **Sjur** can need some help
  with bug fixing in risten.no:-) (note: some of them are feature requests more
  than real bugs)

## Buying

* new external screens for all Divvun workers
