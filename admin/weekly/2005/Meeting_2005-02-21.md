* Corpus DTD: **Tomi and Trond** had a meeting with Lars. **Tomi, Trond and Børre**
  continue the work.
* cochise: **Sjur** has added that issue (potential port crash in Forrest, and how
  to run Forrest on a different port) to the docu.
* Meeting memos: still utf-8 issues. Bug filed on forrest, hopefully resolved
  in a reasonable time. Meeting memos are available in cvs at ```gt/doc/admin/weekly```
* **Børre:** mpage or equiv. Mac OS X has built-in support, but not as pretty as mpage.

* Meeting memo support

* Check if cochise and forrest are working.
* XXE has a patch for support for extended chars available through the option-key.


# 4. Corpus gathering
* letter is translated, Børre to contact Anne Britt
* how should the texts be delivered: (e-mail, physically go to the places ...)

# 5. Corpus infrastructure
* to be cont. in the news group
* Add Lars Nygård to the news group?
* Strictly focused threads (conversion, file structure, etc.)

# 6. Linguistics
* Good meeting in Romsa. We are progressing nicely, several bugs regarding
  adjectives are solved, new ones are filed. The discussion is much more
  focused on the actual problems (file structure and not strictly linguistics),
  for example in Bugzilla Bug 50 has been narrowed down and improved in comparision
  with Bug 39.
* Maaren has again no time (surprise, surprise) (going to Jåhkåmåhkke this week)...
  - I can work at night?

# 7. Term db
* Tomi has a look at perl issues. Conversion from old to new format.
* Børre takes a look at the documentation. Multilingual issue.

# 8. Other issues
*  Quality assurance on documentation.
    -   We need reviewers to read and comment
     the documentation.
    -   Add author and version information in each document
*  pictures in the newsgroup?
    -   yes, Tomi to ask for binary post support in Unison
    -   Trond to bug Erling Paulsen using e-mail from Sjur
*  status report for dis. proj.
    -   "Samisk språkteknologi har laga eit program som kjenner att ca. 95 %
     av orda i løpande tekst, som for desse orda kan gje ordklasse og i dei
     aller fleste tilfella korrekt grammatisk analyse." The system contains
     1167 rules :-), which is about 1/3 of what is needed.
