Present: Tomi, Sjur, Børre

Absent: Maaren, Thomas, Trond

Main secretary: Børre

!!!2. Reviewing the task list from the last meeting

!! Tomi
* three-part compounding
** Nothing done
* decapitalisation of proper nouns when (if?) compounded, and when derived 
  (the oslolaš issue)
** Got a tip from Trond about a Xerox example, but did not have a look at
   the book, and no time do anything with it
* corpus infrastructure: dtd location (both public and internal) 
** Not done
* corpus infrastructure: file and dir organisation
** Nothing done
* Aspell: A simple wordlist based speller
** Working!!
** ... but it's rather big:
*** word list (plain text) is 587 Mb, and after munch-list option it is 433 Mb
** It is rather slow, because it has no affix-file, and the wordlist is huge.
** Tomi will try to make an affix list, based on our lexicon files
** New aspell in cochise!!
*** You can use it temporarily from /home/tomi/bin/aspell and 
    /home/tomi/bin/prezip-bin
*** The new aspell should be installed in a regular location, replacing the old
    one, but that should be checked with sysadm (Roy Dragseth) to make sure we
    don't break anything
* Follow up on CVS mailing:
** check that all received forwarded mail
*** Børre and Sjur is receiving mail as intended now
*** Børre is suggesting that a cvs diff is attached to the commit mails, with
    a diff size limit of, say, 500 lines (excess parts will be skipped)
** set up Thomas and Maaren when they're back from vacation
*** They're still on vacation

!!!3. Documentation - divvun.no

!!Forrest war crashes Tomcat

We have the same problem with risten.no. This blocks the addition of new
functionality (like RSS feeds and jspwiki support), but won't stop us from
updating the content.

Steps to fix this bug (add):
# Take a backup of the present war file (it can be found within the Tomcat webapps/ dir)
# Make sure TWICE that you have that backup in a safe place
# Test both 5.0.29 and 5.5.9 versions of Tomcat, to see if there is any difference
  (or the combination of Tomcat and Forrest)
# try to identify when the bug was introduced (somewhere around the middle of June)
# Report the findings to the Forrest user list

!!Automated update script

Set up the cron job on cochise. Permissions are set correct now, divvun.no can be
manually updated.

!!!4. Corpus gathering

The correct directory for corpus legal things is adm/legal/. The Oslo example should
be added as well. Børre will start with that today.

Then we'll have to write our own contract, adapted to our own needs, and get it rephrased
and checked by a lawyer.

THEN we can start to gather texts:-)

!!!5. Corpus infrastructure

Do documentation.

!!!6. Speller infrastructure

!!aSpell

Is working, see above. Needs further optimisation before it is useful, cf the size
discussion. Size target: At least below 10 Mb, wish: 6 Mb or less.

Write documentation here as well.

!!MS Office spellers

To be specified in the [outsourcing tech-spec|http://divvun.no/adm/outsourcing/tech-spec.html]. What
about direct integration with MS Office? See 
[this page|http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q262605&] from MS.

!!OpenOffice.org

Questions:

!1) Is it possible to use Aspell with OOo?

No. From the [site|http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/]:
{{{
Background
Lingucomponent was started by Kevin Hendricks to integrate various open source spell
checkers into the OpenOffice.org build. With a little prodding from Kevin Atkinson,
the author of Pspell, a new spell checker called MySpell was written in C++ that supported
affix compression, based on Ispell. This code has been given to Pspell and will eventually
make it into a future Pspell release after it has been integrated.

Later note: Pspell is dead and Aspell is its replacement. I think Aspell is found at
aspell.sourceforge.net. There is no OOo interface to Aspell (no way to use Aspell with OOo).
kh.

MySpell, which builds on almost any system, is used to support spell checking in
OpenOffice.org.

!2) Is the Aspell source files compatible with MySpell?

To be investigated. Goal: to simplify
maintenance as much as possible, ie to have as few source and target formats as possible.

!!!7. Other
