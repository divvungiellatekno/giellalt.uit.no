# 3. Documentation

Documentation tasks:

1. Add documentation on our corpus infrastructure and our corpus work in general
  ("To be done by the ones making the corpora": **Børre**, **Tomi**, **Trond**,
  **Saara**).

1. Now  we have 4 documents:
    1. Correct corpus (disamb usage)
    1. Corpus plan (for the disamb corpus cwb)
    1. Corpus conversion, two versions, in infra and in ling. **Tomi** and **Børre**
   have done parallell work ;-(
    1. catxml

For the basic corpora, we need 3 types of documentation, or doc for 3 target
groups:

1. For the users/linguists:
    1. What corpus are found, how do I use them (this info is now scattered)
1. For the collectors:
    1. How do I add texts, where do I add them, how do I convert them (this is the
   Corpus conversion doc)
1. For the programmer
    1. What did I actually do? (this is partly the catxml doc)

For the work on the graphical user interface, we need documentation as well, in
principle along the same lines, except that the user is not the same linguist
as above.

1. add/update Aspell documentation (**Tomi**)
    1. Some documentation has been written, but there still is work to be done.
1. as always: document what you're doing:-) (**all**)

# 4. Corpus gathering

* Governmental documents (earlier in pdf, now in html)

Tasks:
* move existing gov. documents (pdf) from gt/ to our corpus repository (Børre)
* Collect public (pdf and html) files (Børre)

## Contracts

Tasks:
* Follow-up on the lawyers' comments (**Trond** has started with the university)
    - Still more work to be done.
* add a background document explaining the model (**Sjur**)

The most problematic issue:

Who has the copyright of extracted material, like single words, collections of
words, syntactic structure (potentially with some words filled in)? We need
this to be controlled by us, not by the authors. The exact borderline is hard
to define.

## North Sámi New Testament

* If we don't hear anything from Bibelselskapet, we will have to use the version
  we already got.
    - Still not anything. Trond will inform them that we will use what we have.

## Lule Sámi Dictionary

We will invite **Anders Kintel** to a meeting in Tysfjord on Nov 17th, where we
will discuss the possibilities and requirements for cooperation. The overall
meeting in Tysfjord is there to prepare the municipality for being included into
the legally defined Sámi-speaking area.

**Bitte** and **Børre** will participate, as well as **Sjur**, given that
**Anders Kintel** is available.

* **Sjur** will check whether **Berit Karen** has contacted **Anders Kintel**

# 5. Corpus infrastructure

* Wrote new xml-processing tool in C++ to replace catxml-script.
    - where to put it:
        - binary:
        - source:
    - specification:
        - command-line interface
        - what we have already
* the dir reorg disc. betw. Børre and Tomi
    - Directory structure should be defined according to the xml-file metainformation
```
<!-- scheme="dewey" code="44444" -->
<!-- scheme should be dewey or uit or whatever -->
<!-- UiT: bible, news, fiction, facts, adm, ... -->
<!ELEMENT genre EMPTY >
<!ATTLIST genre
            scheme  #PCDATA         #REQUIRED
            code    #PCDATA         #REQUIRED
    >

<genre scheme="uit" code="news" />
<genre scheme="dewey" code="444" />
```

For reference: This is what we decided in Helsinki:

```
    admin/depts/  (governmental departments)
          guovda/ (Guovdageaidnu municipality)
          karas/  (Kárášjohka municipality)
          sd/     (Sámi parliament)
          others/ (everything else)
    bible/ot/
          nt/
    facta/
    ficti/
    laws/
    news/MinAigi
        /Assu
        /NRK
        /YLE
        /other
```

* Reprocess the old (from new dir.) corpus files

## Naming conventions and directory structure

* The original file should be protected using file and directory permission.
* The meta information (i.e., the xsl translation files) should be under version
  control
* Given that our language detection works well, the intermediate file don't need
  to be under version control (the lg identification tool is under gt/script,
  and it needs to be made part of the coprus processing)

Tasks:
1. Make a system for file and directory permission (today: we all belong to the
  cvs group), to only allow people with root user privileges write access to the
  corpus repository, at least regarding original files
1. Include the xsl files under version control (cvs? rcs?)
1. Incorporate language detection as part of the corpus processing.
1. the dir structure is:
    1. one dir for orig, containing also the meta-info and interm. files
    1. another dir for our ready-to-use xml files after conversion
1. dir structure for web-posted corpus files:
    1. subdivision according to week or month, we start out with month till we see
   the amount of traffic (yyyy-mm)
        1. Done
1. we need a way to deal with hyphenated documents in catxml/preprocess:
    1. in normal cases hyphenation points should be removed
    1. when testing the robustness of our parsers, as well as when testing the
   hyphenator, the hyphenation points should be retained

## Corpus conversion

### Pdf to XML

**Saara** has made a new conversion module, it is almost finished. We'll return
to the issue, evaluation, etc. on the next meeting.

Task: **Saara** to prepare for this presentation, and to make documentation.

perldoc gt/script/samiChar/Decode.pm

### (X)HTML to XML

Tomi has been looking at this, and is making an xsl script for it. The web form
developed by **Tomi** should be augmented to allow posting of URL's as well as
documents from the local file system.

The URL posting need to check whether the same URL has been posted before, and
if so, whether the page has changed.

Task: **Tomi** and **Saara** to present status quo and suggest routines, merger,
etc. on the next meeting.

The documentation for corpus conversion should be added to the
gt/doc/ling/corpus_conversion.xml document.

# 6. Linguistics

## Name lexicon

Summary: see the [newsgroup](news:di5mbi$26ad$1@news.uit.no)

Motivation:

* **Divvun:** We want to cross-link different versions of the same locations
 in different languages
* **Common:** We do not want to enter the same names twice. We want a
 language-independent name lexicon
* **Disamb:** Having a richer tag set makes it easier to disambiguate
* **Future:** Richer analysis makes new applications possible, within
 information retrieval, grammar checking, machine translation etc.

Needed: A plan for this project:

a. do the main markup in the present propernoun file
b. make a script for converting it to xml (to be done one time)
c. make a script for xml2lexc (to be done by the makefile)
d. make the tags etc. in the parser

Conversion:

1. This week
    1. clean up the present infl. lexicons (merge BLIND and BERN, VUOLAB and LONDON)
  - **Trond**
    1. Make an emacs mode for markup (**Saara**). Options: fem, mal, sur, plc, org,
   obj, none). Combinations: surplc
1. (end of this week and) Next week:
    1. Mark up as much as possible within a week or so (**Maaren** to do the Sámi
   names, and to split CNAME into BERN and LONDON, **Trond** and **Børre** to
   look at the rest)
    1. Then convert to xml
    1. Then mark up the rest with correct semantic tags
    1. This means we would need a seventh option, the unspecified name.
    1. Look into efficient editing of the XML lexicon
    1. Look into synchronisation issues with risten.no - we want the names there
   as well

Updated status quo:
* Entries:    20000
* Converted:  13500
* Time used:     10 h

Needed tools: An emacs mode doing this (**Saara**):
1.  Go to next " NAME ;" ( where NAME is a string of symbols "A-Z\-")
2.  Wait for input, one of these: m f s p o b
3.  Replace " NAME ;" with " NAME-mal ;", " NAME-fem ;" etc. and go to next
    " NAME ;"

Possible refinement: Encode for combined options (both plc and sur, e.g.)
already in this phase.

Waiting for emacs mode.

##  Twol SETS definition issue

The definition of G1, G2, G3 in Lule Sámi is still open. and we would like to
have input on this issue.

Update: it is still not working, see [bug
193|http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=193]

SUGGESTION (**Trond**): **Thomas**, **Trond** and **Sjur** have a new meeting on
this issue, on Wednesday.

## North Sámi

* three-part compounds issue still open, as is the number project.
* The treatment of Sámi place names, we need a contract with "Norge digitalt",
  via UFD.
    - **Sjur** has written an e-mail to the UFD contact person,
   **Øystein Johannessen,** who will look into it soon. He has not responded
   beyond saying he will return to it. **Sjur** brought this up in the board
   meeting, and **Bjørn Olav Megard** will remind **Øystein Johannessen**
   about this issue. **Sjur** will follow up on this one.
* normativity issues:
    - the Giellalávdegoddi meeting was last Friday, they will have a new meeting in
   December. They were not able to make any decisions, and there will be a new
   Giellalávdegoddi beginning next year who won't make decisions until late
   spring. This is a serious problem for the Divvun problem.
        - Actions: **Sjur** will bring this to the Divvun board, write a new letter to
    the Giellalávdegoddi, emphasizing the needs and timetables of the project

## Lule Sámi

 **Sjur**, **Thomas** and **Trond** will cont. Lule Sámi issues.

## Numerals

1. An empirical overview
    1. Numeral generation
    1. Numeral inflection
    1. Numerals as parts of compounds
1. A clear concept of how we want to treat them
    1. Tagging
1. A treatment

We will return to this issue after the name conversion.

# 7. Speller infrastructure

Nothing this week either.

# 8. Other

## Technical issues

* The mac os / perl bug (at least **Trond** and **Sjur** has it):
    - utf8 "\xC4" does not map to Unicode at /Users/trond/gt/script/preprocess line
   82. This msg did not show up in 10.3 (perl 5.8.1), but does so in 10.4 (perl
   5.8.6). It is probably a perl - OS mismatch. (**Trond**, **Thor Øivind**,
   **Tomi**)
        - Another **example** of the same bug:
        - :"\x{00c3}" does not map to utf8 at ../script/preprocess line 113, <> chunk
    33.

## Bug fixing

**10 open** bugs (and 24 risten.no bugs)

## Buying

* rucksacks for all

## risten.no

* Organisation: could **Tomi** be used, in exchange for more linguistic work by
  (old) GIO members? Yes, it is ok, but how much still needs to be evaluated
* it is ok to integrate "kvensk" placenames with risten.no
    - this should be integrated with the general proper name work - we want all
   proper names integrated with risten.no, df above
    - needs further development of risten.no to allow for multiple XML bases to
   be presented and maintained in parallel. This is to be further worked on by
   **Tomi** and **Sjur**

## Meeting with Kvensk revitalisation project

Grammar, dictionary, placename lexicon for Kvensk. They want similar
infrastructure as in Sámi language technology. **Trond** and **Sjur** will
discuss how we can help them without taking too much attention away from our
real jobs.
