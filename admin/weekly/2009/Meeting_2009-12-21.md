# Infrastructure

## HFST issues

To check out from svn:
```
svn co https://hfst.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/hfst/trunk hfstsvn
```

Remove all old Fink (/sw/) and MacPorts (/opt/) installations, then compile
under Snow Leopard.

**TODO:**
* install HFST for Maja (**Børre**)
    - done for all

## VislCG 3

Everyone should have this one installed as well.

**TODO:**
* install VislCG3 (**Tomi**)
    - not yet, problems with the building (linking ICU)
    - try using the ICU package from MacPorts
* install VislCG3 for Maja and Thomas (**Børre**)
    - done

## Makefile + tag simplification

Present process:
1. tailor the source files
  (remove lines containing SUB, GG, whatever)
1. compile the tmp source files

Goal:
1. compile the source files
1. tailor the resulting transducer
  (subtract the strings containing SUB, GG, whatever)

Also replace xfst script files with -e "action" statements.

Old version:
```
iclock.fst: $(TARGET)/bin/iclock-$(TARGET).fst
$(TARGET)/bin/iclock-$(TARGET).fst: $(TARGET)/bin/clock-$(TARGET).fst
	@echo "*** iclock-$(TARGET).fst ***"
	@printf "load < $(TARGET)/bin/clock-$(TARGET).fst \n\
	invert net \n\
	save stack $@ \n\
	quit \n" >> tmp/iclock-script-$(TARGET)
	$(XFST) < tmp/iclock-script-$(TARGET)
	@rm -f tmp/iclock-script-$(TARGET)
```

New version:

```
iclock.fst: $(TARGET)/bin/iclock-$(TARGET).fst
$(TARGET)/bin/iclock-$(TARGET).fst: $(TARGET)/bin/clock-$(TARGET).fst
	@echo
	@echo "*** $(notdir $@) ***"
	@echo
	@$(XFST) -e "load < $<" \
			 -e "invert net" \
			 -e "save stack $@" \
			 -stop
```

**TODO:**
* discuss and decide upon tag format (**linguists**)
* convert comment tags to real lexc tags when the discussion is over (**Tomi**)

## General list

To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
    1. test bench enhanced, but not yet complet
1. set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
    1. iCal server / group calendars
    1. wiki
1. wiki? on G5 (is part of Snow Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
1. improve Forrest stability and i18n support ( the divvun crashes)
1. reorganise the documentation:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium](http://www.apertium.org/) and 
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
1. update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

**TODO:**
* upgrade the XServe to Snow Leopard Server (**Børre**)
    - done
* ask Lene, Linda to install Mikogo (**Trond**)
* restructure and clean the `script/` directory, using subdirs to categorise
  the scripts (**Ciprian**)
    - please act as suggested, cf comments in the news group
* infrastructure remake: (**Børre, Ciprian, Saara, Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)
    - more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
    - merge gt, kt and st into one
    - modularised preprocess and spellrelax
    - alternatives to make:
        - [SCons](http://www.scons.org/)
        - [makepp](http://makepp.sourceforge.net/)
        - [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (for java-projects)
        - [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/)
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* define and document testing routines (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## South Sámi

Numerals:
* Bergsland, and Spiik for smj as well: gøøkte luhkie gøøkte
* Majja, and Nickel for sme: gøøkteluhkiegøøkte
* Tronds interpretation: Bergsland and Spiik do not reflect the norm, but a
  pedagogical convention to make it easier for readers to understand
* Linguistically, joined writing is correct (ref: TO, the native southerner)

Classification of pronouns etc:
1. personal: manne "I", dïhte "he/she/it"
1. demonstrative: daate "this one"
1. determiner: daennie gåetesne "to that house"

Personal vs demonstrative:
* dihte Pron Pers
* dihte Pron Dem
* Given that "dihte maana" is out, the analysis should be +Pron+Pers and
  not +Det.
* We do not want to disambiguate persons and things as referents,
  therefore we do not want two analyses +Pron+Pers and +Pron+Dem.

Anna Jacobsen:
Dihte Kovlasaemiej åvtohke

Demonstrative vs. determiners
* daate "påpekende pronomen" demonstrative
* gen: daen
* ine: daesnie (Trond: pronoun, sma.fst: +Pron+Dem)
* ine: daennie gåetesne (Trond: determiner, +Det) (sme: Gen)

Here, we should have two paradigms, one pronominal +Pron+Dem, and one
+Det, disambuguating to pre-nominal use.

Three types of problem areas:
* missing closed POSes: errors in transducer, or in PL conversion
* missing words found in the smanob dictionary: 110 verbs, 80 adjectives, all
  core `sma` words (**Cip**: this statistics is NOT complete, as far as I know
  Trond has forgoten to take the Swedish verb file into account!)
* missing list from corpus

We also seem to have problems with derivations:
```
jealadehtedh   jieliedehtedh	jieledh+V+Der1+Der/dehte+V+Inf
galmadehtedh   galmedehtedh	galmedidh+V+Der2+Der/ehte+V+Inf
```

**TODO:**
* Prepare text´s about normativity issue to SGL/SGM (**Maja, Thomas**)
* adjectives (**Maja** with **Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
    - two competing naming conventions of continuation lexicons
        - One naming goes ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE
        - One follows the sme convention of naming key adjectives
        - There are duplicate lexica
    - The comparative issue open here and there
        - The ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE lexica now go to EVENCOMP and
    ODDCOMP only.
* work meeting on loan words and proper nouns, this week - tomorrow?
  (**Maja, Ove (?), Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

**Tomi** has played with [couchdb](http://couchdb.apache.org/) as a replacement
for eXist in risten.no and general dictionary-related work. Seems much lighter
and easier to work with.

Instead of building our own webforms and back-end update scripts, use XForms
with a premade connection to our xml db. Orbeon XForms is such a tool (open
source).

From the meeting with the terminology and IT teams last week:
* no major rework on the present search interface now
* no work on the editing section; instead:
* add existing lists of sanctioned terminology as separate term entities
* add a dictionary if we can make one with sufficient quality

This means the following tasks:
* find already approved lists, in paper or electronic form (**term team**)
* convert paper lists to electronic lists (**term team**)
* convert lists to standard XML (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add prepared lists to risten.no (**Sjur, Tomi**)

**TODO:**
1. send eXist log files to Ciprian (**Sjur**)
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add `nob`
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
  the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
  to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
  official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

Duplicated entries are now mostly removed, and much of the closed POS content
copied from `sme` is now changed into `sma`. But the examples and their
translations are still `sme`.

inc catalogue contains nouns.csv (2132 lines, 2030 unique nouns) and verb.csv 
(1701 lines, 1699 unique verbs). These should be diffed and added. 
Diff: 900 of the 2030 nouns and 1290 of the 1699 verbs are already in the smanob
dictionary

* sma:nob-swe
    - over 400 multiplied entries found (these are coused by a not so clean work
   with the data)
    - done: deleted automatically about 300 of them
    - ongoing: **Maja-Lisa** is checking the entries on correctness
    - ongoing: **Maja-Lisa** is translating the missing words from her own diploma
   thesis into nob
    - ongoing: synchronize data from dictionary with that from lexC files so that
   we are able to analyze everything from the dictonary (**Cip**: this should be 
   valuable for ALL dictionaries)
* fkv:nob and nob:fkv
    - started to work on them: waiting for **Verena** to get rid of multiplied
   entries
* kom:fin-eng
    - moved the original kom-lex.xml to the inc-dir and froze it
    - split it by pos into the working_file dir, the ONLY place to work with
   the dictionary entries
    - now, the lexC files are generated via XSLT sheets, no perl scripts
    - adjusted the Makefile
    - prepared the pipeline for compiling the mac dict
    - todo: make a pipeline for StarDict also (as far as I know, **Jaska** has)
   a Linux machine

**TODO:**
* set up risten.no on eXist/XServe (as a beta version site) (**Sjur**)
* set up required infra for smenob on risten.no/XServe (**Sjur**)
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* end user documentation (how to download and install) (**Ciprian, Trond**)
* Contact *Davvi Girji* about cooperation on electronic dictionaries
  (**Sjur**)
* developing the mobile phone version of smenob:
    - http://pfed.info/wksite/ 
* Komi
    - take out the doublets to a separate file (**Ciprian**)
    - merge the doublets (**Jaska, Trond**)
    - Completing the automaton to some state (**Trond, Jaska, Paula**)
* compile Komi dictionary (**Cirian**)
* compile Kven dictionary (**Cirian**)

# Proofing tools

## South Sámi

**TODO:**
* Go through the phonrules file (**Thomas**)
* Pick a text for proofreading (**Thomas**)
* Proofread a text with tre eror$error notation (**Maja**)
* difftest for fst and PL speller (**Sjur**)
* Compile a new version by Friday (**Tomi**)
    - `cd $GTHOME/prooftools/; sudo make mac-dmg`
* Look for external beta testers?
    - David and Jovsset will get the speller, for other people
   we must wait.
* fix the installer build issues (**Sjur**)
* correct easter egg to say "South Sámi", not "North Sámi" (**Sjur**)
* fix sma installer bugs (**Sjur**)

## HFST-based proofing tools

[Voikko](http://voikko.sf.net) will be our near future proofing solution, using HFST as
the language technology core.

Please join the [libvoikko](http://lists.puimula.org/listinfo/libvoikko) mailing
list.

One article linked:

[http://voikko.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/voikko/trunk/libvoikko/doc/morphological-analysis.txt]

**TODO:**
* continue to write an API specification, and an implementation specification
  (**Sjur**)

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* test new and nested error markup (**Sjur**)
    - nesting still needs to be tested, depends on new `ccat` feature

### Speller testing

**TODO:**
* test the error type selection feature in ccat (**Sjur**)

### Testing open-source Norwegian spellers

**Sjur** has invited the open-source group to test their spell-checker using our
test bench. The response has been positive, we'll see what happens.

We should go to their developer meetings, and present our work and how to work
with language technology.

## Speller bugs

List of bugs returned from Polderland:
* 621
* 630
* 652
* 656
* 676

Tag reordering for abbreviations have caused a lot of problems:
