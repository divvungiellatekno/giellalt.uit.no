!!!Oahpa!

For the autumn there are 3 developmental paths:

# Continuous improvements and smaller additions. This process is running.
# Adding new games (Teksta, etc.). This awaits divine inspiration.
# Adding new target languages. This awaits interest from the potential
  language community, and thereafter financing.

!!!Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in {{plan/strat/5year.jspwiki}}.

!!Northern areas project

__TODO:__
* Attend a beginners' course in Russian (priority: the alphabet!) near you..
* Keep potential key personel alert
* To a certain extent plan for The Thing

!!!Infrastructure

To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

# test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
## test bench enhanced, but not yet complet
# set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
## permanent chat rooms
## stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
## iCal server / group calendars
## wiki
# wiki? on G5 (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
# improve Forrest stability and i18n support ( the divvun crashes)
## __Sjur__ has been working on better i18n and pdf rendering
## __Børre__ has some ideas for getting back to serving static html files
# reorganise the documentation:
## differ between target groups
## get better grouping
## decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium|http://www.apertium.org/] and 
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
## update/add missing parts
# migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
## Name lexica (the Name project)
## Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
## At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
# change the look of the documentation web
# use HFST as alternative to XFST
# corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
# update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

Software update:

SEE 3.5 fixes the lexicn name not displaying in the function popup bug

** alternatives to make:
*** [SCons|http://www.scons.org/]
*** [makepp|http://makepp.sourceforge.net/]
*** [Maven|http://maven.apache.org/] (for java-projects)
*** [CMake|http://www.cmake.org/]

** delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* test iCal Server (on G5) (__Børre__)

!!!Linguistics

We need a more fine-grained system for denoting morphological boundaries. Here's
what __Sjur__ suggests:

# word boundary: ## (# makes .#. unusable in twolc)
# inflection: <, >
# compound-like inflection: <#, #> (cf ''-gujmie'') (lexc %<#, #%>)
# derivation: «, »
# compound-like derivation: «#, #» (cf ''-aktig, -skap'' in nob, swe, etc)
# clitica: ‹, › - ''muorak'' and ''muorage'' but only ''muorasge'' and not
 ''muorask''
# opaque compounds (''bringebær''): {{*#, #* - *}} on the side of the opaque part

The multichar sequences should be defined as {{Multichar_Symbols}}.

It might be possible to distinguish, but do we need them?

the suffix -goahti- behaves:
* morphologically like a compound 
* semantically like a closed-class word (begin, often, still, ...)
* what is ''bringe#bær''? A compound?

Motivation for the new border symbols:
* compound-like inflection and derivation should be hyphenated as compounds,
  although regular inflection and hyphenation usually is completely opaque wrt
  hyphenation.
* we don't want to use the regular word boundary symbol for this purpose, since
  that can conflict with other use cases (like IR & indexing, where you want to
  index both the actual word form, the stem, and possibly substems as long as
  the stemming is transparent)
* on the contrary, a richer set of border symbols can be used to enhance e.g. IR
  - by coding ''bringeber'' as {{bringe*#ber}} we know that the compound is
  opaque and should not be split, but at the same time we know that the last
  part is the recognisable word ''ber'', which can be useful for text
  classification and building semantic relationships - we can automatically
  deduce that ''bringebær'' is a ''bær''.
* the regular affix boundaries have turned out to be useful in the making of
  Hunspell speller files (although the distiction between inflection and
  derivation was in the end not useful). The borders also make it easier to bind
  certain two-level rules to the correct contexts.

The guiding principle behind the symbols is that they provide more information
in the transducer, and it is easy to discard the information later. The opposite
is not true. Also, there is relatively little work involved in adding the
symbols.

!!North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

!!Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

!!South Sámi

Adj->verb derivations is the next topic.
Verb -> adj -derivations (some) already written in, tentatively.
This topic probably needs more consideration than A -> V.

__TODO:__
* reformulate the proper noun grammar according to the Trondheim discussions
  (__Maja, Sjur, Thomas, Trond__)
* Prepare text´s about normativity issue to SGL/SGM (__Maja, Thomas__)
** placenames (__Maja__)
** other issues
* finish the umlaut / derivation work (__Thomas, Sjur, Tomi__)
* adjectives (__Maja__ with __Thomas, Trond, Sjur__)
** two competing naming conventions of continuation lexicons
*** One naming goes ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE
*** One follows the sme convention of naming key adjectives
*** There are duplicate lexica
** The comparative issue open here and there
*** The ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE lexica now go to EVENCOMP and
    ODDCOMP only.

!!!Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

__Tomi__ has played with [couchdb|http://couchdb.apache.org/] as a replacement
for eXist in risten.no and general dictionary-related work. Seems much lighter
and easier to work with.

Instead of building our own webforms and back-end update scripts, use XForms
with a premade connection to our xml db. Orbeon XForms is such a tool (open
source).

From the meeting with the terminology and IT teams last week:
* no major rework on the present search interface now
* no work on the editing section; instead:
* add existing lists of sanctioned terminology as separate term entities
* add a dictionary if we can make one with sufficient quality

This means the following tasks:
* find already approved lists, in paper or electronic form (__term team__)
* convert paper lists to electronic lists (__term team__)
* convert lists to standard XML (__Sjur, Tomi__)
* add prepared lists to risten.no (__Sjur, Tomi__)

__TODO:__
# send eXist log files to Ciprian (__Sjur__)
# fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (__Sjur__)
# fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (__Saara__)
# finish first version of the editing (__Sjur__)
# test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (__Sjur, Thomas, Trond__)
# make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add {{nob}}
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (__Sjur, Saara__)
# convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (__Sjur, Tomi, Saara__)
# implement data synchronisation between [risten.no|http://www.risten.no] and
  the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
  to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
  official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
# start to use the xml file as source file
# clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (__Thomas, linguists__)
# merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (__linguists__)
# publish the name lexicon on risten.no (__Sjur__)
# add missing parallel names for placenames (__linguists__)
# add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (__linguists__)

!!Dictionaries

__TODO:__
* Set up the apache server for the risten.no beta on the linux box + Xserve.
  (__Børre__)
* set up risten.no on eXist/XServe (as a beta version site) (__Sjur__)
* set up required infra for smenob on risten.no/XServe (__Sjur__)
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (__Ciprian, Sjur, Trond__)
* end user documentation (how to download and install) (__Ciprian, Trond__)
* Contact ''Davvi Girji'' about cooperation on electronic dictionaries
  (__Sjur__)
* developing the mobile phone version of smenob:
** http://pfed.info/wksite/ 

!!!Proofing tools

!!HFST-based proofing tools

__TODO:__
* continue to write an API specification, and an implementation specification
  (__Sjur__)

!!Hunspell

__Børre__ has released beta7, with working clitics, negation verb and copula.

!!Testing

!Spelling Error Markup

__TODO:__
* test new and nested error markup (__Sjur__)
** nesting still needs to be tested, depends on new {{ccat}} feature

!Speller testing

__TODO:__
* test the error type selection feature in ccat (__Sjur__)
* package and deliver {{sma}} proofing tools (__Sjur, Tomi__)
* add South Sámi DLL's to the svn repository (__Sjur__)

!Testing open-source Norwegian spellers

__Sjur__ has invited the open-source group to test their spell-checker using our
test bench. The response has been positive, we'll see what happens.

We should go to their developer meetings, and present our work and how to work
with language technology.
