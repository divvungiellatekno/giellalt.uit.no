# Pedagogical software online

Released Thursday last week. There's a bug now for the CG part, **Trond** and
**Saara** are working on it. Otherwise the release was a big success:)

Also good coverage in the Sámi news, see
[this link](http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/158631).

The PR process for the Oahpa! release:
* first press unit at the University
* they make a press release / a story in our internal media
* the external journalists read it
* they come for making reports

Things to learn from the press coverage of the events we have had so far - use
the professionals! That is, the PR people at UiT or SD. Don't write the press
release ourself.

Meeting memos can be found at
[http://giellatekno.uit.no/ped/index.html#Meeting+memos]

**TODO**
* Register oahpa.no (**Trond**)

# Corpus gathering

* March 7, 2009: feedback is provided to proposers
* April 1, 2009 (noon UT): deadline for full proposal submission
* April 21, 2009: final decision

**TODO:**
* continue gathering `sma` corpus texts (**David, Jovsset**)
    - older sámi radio texts would be very welcome as well (**David**)
    - **Maja:** NRK Nord-Trøndelag has a lot of recordings in `sma`, possibly
   also manuscripts - we should call them (**Maja**)
    - call Fylkesmannen i Nordland about `sma` material (**Maja**)
    - send **Fritz Jakobssen** a contract (**Maja**)
    - Š-bláđđi has some articles in `sma`, we should ask for permission to use it
   (**David**)
    - follow up on the `sma` Bible translations (**David**)
    - the Gun Utsi book is almost there - one contract missing (**Jovsset**)
* other contacts: Lena Davidsson, daughter to Lars-Matto Tuolja
* make a 1-page, light version of the contract, also in Swedish
  (**Børre, David, Sjur, Trond**)
    - Bokmål and Northern Sami versions are commited at `xtdoc/sd/src/documentation/content/xdocs/adm/legal/short-contract.(nb|se).xml`
    - meeting to go through the 1-page version Feb. 11, at 9:30 Norw. time
* discuss infra improvements for corpus rep administration (**Børre, Ciprian**)
    - delayed till we are done with the `gt/Makefile` improvements

# Promoting Divvun

We need more promotions of the Divvun tools. Making a movie demonstrating its use (screencast), and put it up on Youtube.

**TODO:**
* chron task for updating online download log once a week (**Børre**)
* make leaflet to inform about the project (**Jovsset, David**)
    - better Windows usage descriptions, with emphasis on the pitfalls
   (**Jovsset**)
    - add link to OOo installation and usage instructions (**Sjur**)
    - improve OOo instructions (**Børre**)
    - add Linux info (**Børre**)

  sami centres in all of Sápmi. Gaaltije in Östersund for example.
  (**Leif Åge, Jovsset**)
* contact MS Nordic, and ask them to include the Divvun tools in the next Office
  releases (both Windows and Mac). The integration can/should be done by
  Polderland, which is an official MS subcontractor/integrator. It could be used
  by MS as part of their advertising for the next releases, and it will make it
  much easier for people to get access to the tools. (**Sjur**)
* prepare to go to Røyrvik and promote Dåvvome (**David**)

# Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in `plan/strat/5year.jspwiki`.

# Infrastructure

**Børre** has installed `giza++, mosesdecoder, srilm, mkcl` etc on the XServe,
which will facilitate statistically based machine translation. There are
experiments with the two ways of doing MT:

* rule-based machine translation 
    - based on apertium: sme2smj
    - based on cg?
* statistical machine translation - ideas/plans for the future:
    - sme2smj (for comparison), 
    - sme2nob (gist translation), 
    - nob2sme (OpenOffice.org localisation etc.)

To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
    1. test bench enhanced, but not yet complet
1. set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
    1. permanent chat rooms
    1. stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
    1. iCal server / group calendars
    1. wiki
1. wiki? on G5 (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
1. improve Forrest stability and i18n support ( the divvun crashes)
    1. **Sjur** has been working on better i18n and pdf rendering
    1. **Børre** has some ideas for getting back to serving static html files
1. reorganise the documentation:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium](http://www.apertium.org/) and 
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. sfst?
    1. replacement for xfst -> see [omorf
| http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/kieliteknologia/tutkimus/omor/index.shtml],
   [omorf wiki](https://kitwiki.csc.fi/twiki/bin/view/KitWiki/HfstHome) and
   [omorfi](https://gna.org/projects/omorfi)
    1. replacement for hunspell/open-source proofing tools
1. investigate the [NSIS installer](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page),
  potentially replacing the InstallShield
  package from Polderland
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
1. update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

SVN issues:
* http access not yet available (https only at the moment, but it works as
  anonymous checkout if the user is *not* specified)
* read access to the whole repo is working, BUT:
    - `gt/*/polderland` should be protected
    - `plan` should be protected
* certain users need to be on the UiT VPN to be able to commit (bug #705)
* UTF-8 problem in svn commit mails: the commit log text is garbled

**TODO:**
* infrastructure remake: (**Børre, Ciprian, Saara, Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)
    - more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
    - merge gt, kt and st into one
    - modularised preprocess and spellrelax
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* define and document testing routines (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* follow-up migration to svn:
    - close the open SVN repository at requested paths (**Ciprian**)
        - completely closed at the moment, until we have solved the path-based control
    - prepare and discuss with external users: Jack Ruether (**Trond**)
* test iCal Server (on G5) (**Børre**)
* remove TOC from the giellatekno home page by using dispatcher (**Trond**)

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

Instead of building our own webforms and back-end update scripts, use XForms
with a premade connection to our xml db. Orbeon XForms is such a tool (open
source).

From the meeting with the terminology and IT teams last week:
* no major rework on the present search interface now
* no work on the editing section; instead:
* add existing lists of sanctioned terminology as separate term entities
* add a dictionary if we can make one with sufficient quality

This means the following tasks:
* find already approved lists, in paper or electronic form (**term team**)
* convert paper lists to electronic lists (**term team**)
* convert lists to standard XML (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add prepared lists to risten.no (**Sjur, Tomi**)

**TODO:**
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add `nob`
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
  the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
  to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
  official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

Our first electronic dictionary was released together with Oahpa! last week.
There are certain problems on the Windows side for StarDict. Mainly, we need to
improve our user documentation, but it is too short at the moment. And the
StarDict download for Windows need to be a zip file, not tar.

The dictionary works well on Linux as well, **Børre** tested it with QStarDict.
But the documentation is lacking (missing?) for Linux.

There are other dictionaries available for StarDict on
[http://xdxf.revdanica.com/down2/index.php?down_format=StarDict]

**TODO:**
* Set up the apache server for the risten.no beta on the linux box + Xserve.
  (**Børre**)
    - not yet done
* set up Tomcat and eXist (latest svn) on XServe (**Børre**)
    - done
* set up risten.no on eXist/XServe (as a beta version site) (**Sjur**)
    - not done
* set up required infra for smenob on risten.no/XServe (**Sjur**)
    - waiting for the above
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* end user documentation (how to download and install) (**Ciprian, Trond**)
    - started, not complete
* make a public release
    - done
* Contact *Davvi Girji* about cooperation on electronic dictionaries
  (**Sjur**)
* update and split dictionary user documentation before Thursday
  (**Børre, Sjur, Trond**)
    - done

# Proofing tools

## Hunspell

Making compounding work correctly in Hunspell is too much work, the formalism is
too cumbersome and different from what we have. We are looking at alternatives
to Hunspell, and will return to this issue later.

The version we have at the moment (beta6) will be our last one for a while.

## OpenXSpell

Working everywhere (almost) in MacOS X applications, provides Sámi spell
checking system-wide through a hunspell back-end.
[OpenXSPell](http://www.cygnusblack.co.uk/openxspell/index.html)

As a middle-man between Enchant and MacOS X speller API, this is still
interesting. As a direct Hunspell front-end it is not, cf above.

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)
* test new and nested error markup (**Sjur**)
    - nesting still needs to be tested, depends on new `ccat` feature

### Speller testing

**TODO:**
* test the error type selection feature in ccat (**Sjur**)

### Testing open-source Norwegian spellers

**Sjur** has invited the open-source group to test their spell-checker using our
test bench. The response has been positive, we'll see what happens.

We should go to their developer meetings, and present our work and how to work
with language technology.

School in Troms have second week in mars

## Sámi week in Tromsø

The Oahpa! release was awesome, see above. Also the dictionary release. The
library presentation had too few attendees:/

The meeting with the minority language watch-dog was ok. **Trond** reported on
several points, especially the lack of support for the Sámi letters in
governmental registries.

## Text to speech

The TTS meeting with Antti was held (without Maja and Thomas). Topics:
* what kind of feedback is needed from us? Quite a lot of linguistics

**TODO:**
* meeting with **Antti Suni** during the Sámi week
  (**Maja, Ove Lorentz, Thomas, Trond**)

## TNC, rikstermbanken and Sámi terms

* Mekanihkartearbmat
* Pedagogalaš ja psykologalaš tearbmat (?)

It should be ok, but they need to send a formal request, to
samediggi@samediggi.no. From there it will be forwarded to the relevant person.

## Corpus contracts + open source

Postponed until the svn repository is fully functional (it is too open now).

## Other issues

* Maja would like to have a bigger monitor -> coming soon (it is ordered)
    - nothing new yet - **Børre** will call and check

# Next meeting, closing

The meeting was closed at 12:38.
