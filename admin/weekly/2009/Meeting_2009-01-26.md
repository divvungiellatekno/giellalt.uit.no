# Pedagogical software online

Added a place-name fst to be able to provide corrections to Norwegian names that
should have been in Sámi, and vice versa, and the rest of the world, and Lule,
and South.

Usage:
```
makeall.sh
lookup -flags mbTT words/dicts/smi/geo/bin/geo.fst
```

Meeting memos can be found at
[http://giellatekno.uit.no/ped/index.html#Meeting+memos]

**TODO**
* Register oahpa.no (**Trond**)
    - We will go for the uit version by now.
* Beta test at lib and give feedback (**all**)

# Corpus gathering

**TODO:**
* continue gathering `sma` corpus texts (**David, Jovsset**)
    - Sámi Radio texts from the last two years added
    - older texts would be very welcome as well (**David**)
    - **Maja:** NRK Nord-Trøndelag has a lot of recordings in `sma`, possibly
   also manuscripts - we should call them (**Maja**)
    - **David:** called Fylkesmannen i Nordland about `sma` material, but could
   not get hold of the relevant person, **Maja** will follow up
    - we should call **Fritz Jakobssen**, husband of **Anna Jakobssen**, to get
   permission to use her manuscript (**Maja**)
    - Š-bláđđi has some articles in `sma`, we should ask for permission to use it
   (**David**)
    - follow up on the `sma` Bible translations (**David**)
    - meeting on Friday 23rd 09:30 AM to discuss further `sma` corpus gathering
   (**Børre, David, Jovsset, Maja, Sjur**)
        - done
* transfer the `smj` texts by **Kurt Tore** and **Ulf Stefan Winka** to our
  corpus repository (**Per-Eric**)
    - remind him (**Thomas**)
        - done, it seems like all the texts that P-E has, are transfered
* other contacts: Lena Davidsson, daughter to Lars-Matto Tuolja
* make a 1-page, light version of the contract, also in Swedish
  (**Børre, David, Sjur, Trond**)
    - Bokmål and Northern Sami versions are commited at `xtdoc/sd/src/documentation/content/xdocs/adm/legal/short-contract.(nb|se).xml`
    - meeting to go through the 1-page version Feb. 11, at 9:30 Norw. time
* discuss infra improvements for corpus rep administration (**Børre, Ciprian**)
    - delayed till we are done with the `gt/Makefile` improvements

# Promoting Divvun

**TODO:**
* chron task for updating download log once a month (week?) (**Børre**)
* make leaflet to inform about the project (**Jovsset, David**)
    - better Windows usage descriptions, with emphasis on the pitfalls
   (**Jovsset**)
    - add link to OOo installation and usage instructions (**Sjur**)
    - improve OOo instructions (**Børre**)
    - add Linux info (**Børre**)

  sami centres in all of Sápmi. Gaaltije in Östersund for example.
  (**Leif Åge, Jovsset**)
* contact MS Nordic, and ask them to include the Divvun tools in the next Office
  releases (both Windows and Mac). The integration can/should be done by
  Polderland, which is an official MS subcontractor/integrator. It could be used
  by MS as part of their advertising for the next releases, and it will make it
  much easier for people to get access to the tools. (**Sjur**)
* write a short memo from the meeting with **John Marcus** (**Jovsset**)
* prepare to go to Røyrvik and promote Dåvvome (**David**)

# Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in `plan/strat/5year.jspwiki`.

# Infrastructure

**Børre** has installed `giza++, mosesdecoder, srilm, mkcl` etc on the XServe,
which will facilitate statistically based machine translation. There are
experiments with the two ways of doing MT:

* rule-based machine translation
    - based on apertium: sme2smj
    - based on cg?
* statistical machine translation - ideas/plans for the future:
    - sme2smj (for comparison),
    - sme2nob (gist translation),
    - nob2sme (OpenOffice.org localisation etc.)

To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
    1. test bench enhanced, but not yet complet
1. set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
    1. permanent chat rooms
    1. stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
    1. iCal server / group calendars
    1. wiki
1. wiki? on G5 (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
1. improve Forrest stability and i18n support ( the divvun crashes)
    1. **Sjur** has been working on better i18n and pdf rendering
    1. **Børre** has some ideas for getting back to serving static html files
1. reorganise the documentation:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium](http://www.apertium.org/) and
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. sfst?
    1. replacement for xfst -> see [omorf
| http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/kieliteknologia/tutkimus/omor/index.shtml],
   [omorf wiki](https://kitwiki.csc.fi/twiki/bin/view/KitWiki/HfstHome) and
   [omorfi](https://gna.org/projects/omorfi)
    1. replacement for hunspell/open-source proofing tools
1. investigate the [NSIS installer](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page),
  potentially replacing the InstallShield
  package from Polderland
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
1. update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

SVN issues:
* http access not yet available (https only at the moment, but it works as
  anonymous checkout if the user is *not* specified)
* read access to the whole repo is working, BUT:
    - `gt/*/polderland` should be protected
    - `plan` should be protected
* certain users need to be on the UiT VPN to be able to commit (bug #705)
* UTF-8 problem in svn commit mails: the commit log text is garbled

SVN mail issue - solved.

**TODO:**
* infrastructure remake: (**Børre, Ciprian, Saara, Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)
    - more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
    - merge gt, kt and st into one
    - modularised preprocess and spellrelax
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* define and document testing routines (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* follow-up migration to svn:
    - close the open SVN repository at requested paths (**Ciprian**)
        - completely closed at the moment, until we have solved the path-based control
    - prepare and discuss with external users: Jack Ruether (**Trond**)
* test iCal Server (on G5) (**Børre**)
* remove TOC from the giellatekno home page by using dispatcher (**Trond**)

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

Instead of building our own webforms and back-end update scripts, use XForms
with a premade connection to our xml db. Orbeon XForms is such a tool (open
source).

From the meeting with the terminology and IT teams last week:
* no major rework on the present search interface now
* no work on the editing section; instead:
* add existing lists of sanctioned terminology as separate term entities
* add a dictionary if we can make one with sufficient quality

This means the following tasks:
* find already approved lists, in paper or electronic form (**term team**)
* convert paper lists to electronic lists (**term team**)
* convert lists to standard XML (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add prepared lists to risten.no (**Sjur, Tomi**)

**TODO:**
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add `nob`
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
   the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
   to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
   official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

Status:
**Ciprian** has redone the makefile and the build process, generalized and
standardised.

The scripts in `gt/smX/testing/` should go to a more general and shared
location.

The dictinary build command:
```
dicts$ make wordform_macdict S_LANG=sme T_LANG=nob
```

When will we have a Mac and PC dictionary to use and test? Wednesday.

Documentation (link below) must be written and translated, at least into
Norwegian.

Tomcat, eXist are needed in order to make the dictionaries accessible on the
web, as well as svn check-out and testing.

The www.divvun.no setup is appr 1 1/2 year old. The question is to what extent
this setup will work with the present eXist version.

* http://giellatekno.uit.no/dict.eng.html
* http://www.divvun.no:8889/index.html

**TODO:**
* Set up the apache server for the risten.no beta on the linux box + Xserve.
  (**Børre**)
* set up Tomcat and eXist (latest svn) on XServe (**Børre**)
* set up risten.no on eXist/XServe (as a beta version site) (**Sjur**)
* set up required infra for smenob on risten.no/XServe (**Sjur**)
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* end user documentation (how to download and install) (**Ciprian, Trond**)
* make simple installer applications?
* make a public release
    - Make a homepage with instructions for dictionary use:
   `xtdoc/gtuit/src/documentation/content/xdocs/dict.eng.xml`
    - Clarify the difference between local and online dictionaries:
        - Plugin for Firefox and Internet Explorer (online dictionaries)
* Contact *Davvi Girji* about cooperation on electronic dictionaries
  (**Sjur**)
* short meeting to go through missing points before a release - Wednesday 13:00
  (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond, Børre**)

# Proofing tools

## Hunspell

**Børre** did some investigations on compounding syntax - it does not look good.

**TODO:**
* work on and debug compounds (**Børre, Thomas**)

## OpenXSpell

Working everywhere (almost) in MacOS X applications, provides Sámi spell
checking system-wide through a hunspell back-end.
[OpenXSPell](http://www.cygnusblack.co.uk/openxspell/index.html)

There are two issues:
* strings with non-ASCII chars are always flagged
* asking for suggestions on words with non-ASCII chars crashes OpenXSpell

Another option could be CheckSpell. Seems to be more stable and developed. See
[http://web.mac.com/heidi17/Heidikowa_witryna/CheckSpell.html].

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (**Saara**)
* test new and nested error markup (**Sjur**)
    - nesting still needs to be tested, depends on new `ccat` feature

### Speller testing

**TODO:**
* test the error type selection feature in ccat (**Sjur**)

# Other

## Sámi week in Tromsø

**Antti Suni** is coming => meetings with at least **Biret Ánne, Trond** and
**Patrik Bye** and **Ove Lorentz**. On Friday there will be a university
strategy seminar - should somebody go there?

Schedule:
* Monday: 13.00 Library presentation (**Trond**)
* Tuesday: 11.00 European Charter for regional languages will have a meeting
  (**Jovvset, Trond**
  are going there
* Thursday 14:15: [Release of Oahpa + dict](http://www.sami.uit.no/samisk_uke/)
  + release party in Árdna, directly afterwards
  (**Biret Ánne, Ciprian, Lene, Saara, Trond**)

## Text to speech

Antti has hinted at the possibility of doing beta versions of other
languages as well. We are thus now recording Greenlandic sentences. A further
possibility would be smj, sma, this would require phon-smX.xfst files for
these languages as well (a couple of days' work for smj, more for sma), plus
recording.

**TODO:**
