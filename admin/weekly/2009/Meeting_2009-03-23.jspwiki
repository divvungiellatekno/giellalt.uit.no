* Check for IP numbers in the log (__Trond__)
* Improve the fst handling (__Trond__)

!!!Corpus gathering

__David__ has talked more to ''Š bláđi'', they seem positive about giving us a
substantial amount of their texts.

__TODO:__
* continue gathering {{sma}} corpus texts (__David, Jovsset__)
** older sámi radio texts would be very welcome as well (__David__)
** __Maja:__ NRK Nord-Trøndelag has a lot of recordings in {{sma}}, possibly
   also manuscripts - we should call them. We should wait, because I think they
   haven´t any manuscripts. We should talk to the south-sámi journalisth in NRK
   Sámeradio about manuskripts. We have allready Anna Jacobsen manuscripts,
   perhaps Anna Granefjell do have some? Sig-Britt Pärsson? Ristin Pärsson?
   Kjell Roger Appfjell? (__Maja__)
** call Fylkesmannen i Nordland about {{sma}} material (__Maja__)
** send __Fritz Jakobssen__ a contract (__Maja__)
*** he has received the contract, and will return it soon.
** Š-bláđđi has some articles in {{sma}}, we should ask for permission to use it
   (__David__)
*** __David__ has talked to them, will make a contract with them and __Iđut__
** follow up on the {{sma}} Bible translations (__David__)
** the Gun Utsi book is almost there - one contract missing (__Jovsset__)
* other contacts: Lena Davidsson, daughter to Lars-Matto Tuolja
* discuss infra improvements for corpus rep administration (__Børre, Ciprian__)
** delayed till we are done with the {{gt/Makefile}} improvements

!!!Promoting Divvun

We need more promotions of the Divvun tools. Making a movie demonstrating its
use (screencast), and put it up on Youtube.

Next tour de Divvun probably in week 13. __Per-Eric__ has talked to Sámij
åhpadusguovdásj in Jokkmokk, they would also like to get a presentation.

Presentation in Trondheim:
* Divvun - what has happened since last year?
* Oahpa
* Dictionaries:
** smenob
** smanob/swe ?

Bring 50 CD's and leaflets to Trondheim. Contract copies for people to take home.

60 more CDs
20 long contracts
70 short contracts

no leaflet.

__TODO:__
* make leaflet to inform about the project (__Jovsset, David__)
** better Windows usage descriptions, with emphasis on the pitfalls
   (__Jovsset__)
** add Linux info (__Børre__)
*** will do this this week
** add InDesign text (__Sjur__) - requires installer
*** we now have an installer, but the text needs to be updated
** make XSL script to transform Forrest XDocs to an OOo Drawer document
   (__Børre, Sjur__)
* distribute CD version through the library bus, the language centres and common
  sami centres in all of Sápmi. Gaaltije in Östersund for example.
  (__Leif Åge, Jovsset__)
* contact MS Nordic, and ask them to include the Divvun tools in the next Office
  releases (both Windows and Mac). The integration can/should be done by
  Polderland, which is an official MS subcontractor/integrator. It could be used
  by MS as part of their advertising for the next releases, and it will make it
  much easier for people to get access to the tools. (__Sjur__)
* prepare to go to Røyrvik and promote Dåvvome (__David__)
** old date cancelled, no new date, but probably in April
* make a screencast of using our tools (__Børre__)
** first screencasts made, links to appear
* "order" 50 CD's from __Leif Åge__ (__David__)
** done, Randi Juuso brings them to Trondheim
* print 50 leaflets and send them to Trondheim (__Børre__)

!!!Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in {{plan/strat/5year.jspwiki}}.

!!Northern areas project

Collective congratulations!

The money will be in the next state budget, meaning potentially a project start
January 1, 2010. We need to prepare for such a project start, even though we
don't know that we will get the money.

__TODO:__
* Attend a beginners' course in Russian (priority: the alphabet!) near you..
* Keep potential key personel alert
* To a certain extent plan for The Thing

!!!Infrastructure

To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

# test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
## test bench enhanced, but not yet complet
# set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
## permanent chat rooms
## stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
## iCal server / group calendars
## wiki
# wiki? on G5 (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
# improve Forrest stability and i18n support ( the divvun crashes)
## __Sjur__ has been working on better i18n and pdf rendering
## __Børre__ has some ideas for getting back to serving static html files
# reorganise the documentation:
## differ between target groups
## get better grouping
## decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium|http://www.apertium.org/] and
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
## update/add missing parts
# migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
## Name lexica (the Name project)
## Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
## At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
# change the look of the documentation web
# use HFST as alternative to XFST
# corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
# update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

SVN issues:
* http access not yet available (https only at the moment, but it works as
  anonymous checkout if the user is ''not'' specified)
* read access to the whole repo is working, BUT:
** {{gt/*/polderland}} should be protected
** {{plan}} should be protected
* certain users need to be on the UiT VPN to be able to commit (bug #705)
* UTF-8 problem in svn commit mails: the commit log text is garbled

SVN strategies:
* split the repository into two, or move the closed parts to the root of our present svn repository?
* the continuation depends on the above

__TODO:__
* infrastructure remake: (__Børre, Ciprian, Saara, Sjur, Tomi, Trond__)
** more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
** merge gt, kt and st into one
** modularised preprocess and spellrelax
** alternatives to make:
*** [SCons|http://www.scons.org/]
*** [makepp|http://makepp.sourceforge.net/]
*** [Maven|http://maven.apache.org/] (for java-projects)
*** [CMake|http://www.cmake.org/]
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (__Ciprian, Sjur, Trond__)
** delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* define and document testing routines (__Ciprian, Sjur, Trond__)
** delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* follow-up migration to svn:
** close the open SVN repository at requested paths (__Ciprian__)
*** completely closed at the moment, until we have solved the path-based control
** prepare and discuss with external users: Jack Ruether (__Trond__)
* test iCal Server (on G5) (__Børre__)
* remove TOC from the giellatekno home page by using dispatcher (__Trond__)
* meeting to discuss SVN reorg to resolve the access control thing - Wedn. 9.30
  (__Børre, Ciprian, Sjur, Tomi, Trond__)
** done
** suggestion: just move to top-level folders first, then reorganise, and
   finally split

!!!Linguistics

We need a more fine-grained system for denoting morphological boundaries. Here's
what __Sjur__ suggests:

{{{
# word boundary: ## (# makes .#. unusable in twolc)
# inflection: <, >
# compound-like inflection: <#, #> (cf ''-gujmie'') (lexc %<#, #%>)
# derivation: «, »
# compound-like derivation: «#, #» (cf ''-aktig, -skap'' in nob, swe, etc)
# clitica: ‹, › - ''muorak'' and ''muorage'' but only ''muorasge'' and not
 ''muorask''
# opaque compounds (''bringebær''): *#, #* - * on the side of the opaque part
}}}

The multichar sequences should be defined as {{Multichar_Symbols}}.

It might be possible to distinguish, but do we need them?

the suffix -goahti- behaves:
* morphologically like a compound
* semantically like a closed-class word (begin, often, still, ...)
* what is ''bringe#bær''? A compound?

Motivation for the new border symbols:
* compound-like inflection and derivation should be hyphenated as compounds,
  although regular inflection and hyphenation usually is completely opaque wrt
  hyphenation.
* we don't want to use the regular word boundary symbol for this purpose, since
  that can conflict with other use cases (like IR & indexing, where you want to
  index both the actual word form, the stem, and possibly substems as long as
  the stemming is transparent)
* on the contrary, a richer set of border symbols can be used to enhance e.g. IR
  - by coding ''bringeber'' as {{bringe*#ber}} we know that the compound is
  opaque and should not be split, but at the same time we know that the last
  part is the recognisable word ''ber'', which can be useful for text
  classification and building semantic relationships - we can automatically
  deduce that ''bringebær'' is a ''bær''.
* the regular affix boundaries have turned out to be useful in the making of
  Hunspell speller files (although the distiction between inflection and
  derivation was in the end not useful). The borders also make it easier to bind
  certain two-level rules to the correct contexts.

The guiding principle behind the symbols is that they provide more information
in the transducer, and it is easy to discard the information later. The opposite
is not true. Also, there is relatively little work involved in adding the
symbols.

!!North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

!!Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

!!South Sámi

__TODO:__
* reformulate the proper noun grammar according to the Trondheim discussions
  (__David, Maja, Sjur, Thomas, Trond__)
* Missing list (focus on closed class words and addition on missing nouns,
  adjectives and verbs) (__David__)
** __David__ made a new missing list from an OCR-ed book
* make a document for the SGL/SGM, {{sma}} section (__David__ with
  __Maja, Sjur__)
** placenames (__Jovsset__)
** abbreviations (__David__)
* finish the umlaut / derivation work (__Thomas, Sjur, Tomi__)
* adjectives (__Maja__ with __David, Thomas, Trond, Sjur__)

!!!Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

Instead of building our own webforms and back-end update scripts, use XForms
with a premade connection to our xml db. Orbeon XForms is such a tool (open
source).

From the meeting with the terminology and IT teams last week:
* no major rework on the present search interface now
* no work on the editing section; instead:
* add existing lists of sanctioned terminology as separate term entities
* add a dictionary if we can make one with sufficient quality

This means the following tasks:
* find already approved lists, in paper or electronic form (__term team__)
* convert paper lists to electronic lists (__term team__)
* convert lists to standard XML (__Sjur, Tomi__)
* add prepared lists to risten.no (__Sjur, Tomi__)

__TODO:__
# fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (__Sjur__)
# fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (__Saara__)
# finish first version of the editing (__Sjur__)
# test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (__Sjur, Thomas, Trond__)
# make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add {{nob}}
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (__Sjur, Saara__)
# convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (__Sjur, Tomi, Saara__)
# implement data synchronisation between [risten.no|http://www.risten.no] and
  the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
  to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
  official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
# start to use the xml file as source file
# clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (__Thomas, linguists__)
# merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (__linguists__)
# publish the name lexicon on risten.no (__Sjur__)
# add missing parallel names for placenames (__linguists__)
# add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (__linguists__)

!!Dictionaries

Ciprian is working towards our first {{sma-nob/swe}} dictionary, coming today?

__TODO:__
* Technical meeting - Wed. 12.30: (__Sjur, Trond, Ciprian__)
** done
** Windows: Stardict and its possible replacement
** Compilation and pipeline
* smadic meeting: How to copy smenob work - Tue 9.30
  (__Ciprian, Trond, Lene, Maja, David__)
** done
* Set up the apache server for the risten.no beta on the linux box + Xserve.
  (__Børre__)
* set up risten.no on eXist/XServe (as a beta version site) (__Sjur__)
** not yet done
* set up required infra for smenob on risten.no/XServe (__Sjur__)
** waiting for the above
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (__Ciprian, Sjur, Trond__)
* end user documentation (how to download and install) (__Ciprian, Trond__)
** started, not complete
* Contact ''Davvi Girji'' about cooperation on electronic dictionaries
  (__Sjur__)

!!!Proofing tools

!!HFST-based proofing tools

__TODO:__
* start to write an API specification, and an implementation specification
  (__Sjur__)

!!Hunspell

__Børre__ has released beta7, with working clitics, negation verb and copula.

!!OpenXSpell

As a middle-man between Enchant and MacOS X speller API, this is still
interesting. As a direct Hunspell front-end it is not, cf above.

!!Testing

!Spelling Error Markup

__TODO:__
* Set up ways of adding meta-information (source info, used in testing or not,
  added to lexicon or not) (__Saara__)
* test new and nested error markup (__Sjur__)
** nesting still needs to be tested, depends on new {{ccat}} feature

!Speller testing

__TODO:__
* test the error type selection feature in ccat (__Sjur__)

!Testing open-source Norwegian spellers

__Sjur__ has invited the open-source group to test their spell-checker using our
test bench. The response has been positive, we'll see what happens.

We should go to their developer meetings, and present our work and how to work
with language technology.
