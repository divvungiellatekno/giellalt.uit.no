# Infrastructure

## SSH at UiT

* the divvun.no server has been closed for SSH access by the UiT IT admin
* we have not been informed about this
* this is effectively stopping all access from the outside world
* VCN/Remote Desktop access is still allowed
* the reason is that one Mac has been compromised by a hacker

## HFST issues

* HFST in apertium, to avoid conversion to the apertium automata thing

```
$ echo "ja+CC" | ./hfst-lookup smj-gen.hfst
ja+CC	@#@ja@#@
ja+CC	@#@ja
ja+CC	ja@#@
ja+CC	ja

Sjur-si-proffbok:gt sjur$ echo "ja+CC" | hfst-lookup smj/bin/smj-gen.hfst
ja+CC	ja
```

Yes, this was a bug, but it is fixed. Make sure everything is the latest version,
including the transducer (recompile if needed).

HFST installation issues:
* Trond
* Thomas via Børre

To check out from svn:
```
svn co https://hfst.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/hfst/trunk hfstsvn
```

Remove all old Fink (/sw/) and MacPorts (/opt/) installations, then compile under Snow Leopard.

## General list

To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
    1. test bench enhanced, but not yet complet
1. set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
    1. permanent chat rooms
    1. stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
    1. iCal server / group calendars
    1. wiki
1. wiki? on G5 (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
1. improve Forrest stability and i18n support ( the divvun crashes)
    1. **Sjur** has been working on better i18n and pdf rendering
    1. **Børre** has some ideas for getting back to serving static html files
1. reorganise the documentation:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium](http://www.apertium.org/) and
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. use HFST as alternative to XFST
    1. this is now a real option (HFST2 is released), reqiures Makefile enhancements
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
1. update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

**TODO:**
* install the HFST tools (**Børre, Tomi**)
    - done
    - usage: `make hfst TARGET=xxx`, or use `hwfst` if you want a weighted one
    - fao: `make hfst`
* upgrade the XServe to Snow Leopard Server (**Børre**)
* ask Lene, Linda to install Mikogo (**Trond**)
* restructure and clean the script catalogue, using subdirs to categorise the
  scripts (**Ciprian**)
    - see posting in the news group
* infrastructure remake: (**Børre, Ciprian, Saara, Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)
    - more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
    - merge gt, kt and st into one
    - modularised preprocess and spellrelax
    - alternatives to make:
        - [SCons](http://www.scons.org/)
        - [makepp](http://makepp.sourceforge.net/)
        - [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (for java-projects)
        - [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/)
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* define and document testing routines (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process

# Linguistics

## Giellatekno usage evaluation

Trond is presenting. Inspiring data:)

Comments:
* word form generation isn't possible to use unless you know the tags used as input
* no colours for syntax analysis
* we should redirect users who want MT or English analyses to appropriate sites

## North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## South Sámi

**TODO:**
* Prepare text´s about normativity issue to SGL/SGM (**Maja, Thomas**)
    - meeting Tuesday 9:30 (**Maja, Sjur, Thomas**)
        - done, a bit delayed
* adjectives (**Maja** with **Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
    - two competing naming conventions of continuation lexicons
        - One naming goes ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE
        - One follows the sme convention of naming key adjectives
        - There are duplicate lexica
    - The comparative issue open here and there
        - The ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE lexica now go to EVENCOMP and
    ODDCOMP only.
* work meeting on loan words and proper nouns, this week - tomorrow?
  (**Maja, Ove (?), Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

**Tomi** has played with [couchdb](http://couchdb.apache.org/) as a replacement
for eXist in risten.no and general dictionary-related work. Seems much lighter
and easier to work with.

Instead of building our own webforms and back-end update scripts, use XForms
with a premade connection to our xml db. Orbeon XForms is such a tool (open
source).

From the meeting with the terminology and IT teams last week:
* no major rework on the present search interface now
* no work on the editing section; instead:
* add existing lists of sanctioned terminology as separate term entities
* add a dictionary if we can make one with sufficient quality

This means the following tasks:
* find already approved lists, in paper or electronic form (**term team**)
* convert paper lists to electronic lists (**term team**)
* convert lists to standard XML (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add prepared lists to risten.no (**Sjur, Tomi**)

**TODO:**
1. send eXist log files to Ciprian (**Sjur**)
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add `nob`
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
  the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
  to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
  official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

The lexicography workshop was a great success. We should sum it all up, and
improve what can be improved. Also, computer illiteracy is a problem.

**TODO:**
* meeting to sum up experiences after the lexicography seminar, Tuesday
  (**Børre, Ciprian, Lene, Sjur, Trond**)
* set up risten.no on eXist/XServe (as a beta version site) (**Sjur**)
* set up required infra for smenob on risten.no/XServe (**Sjur**)
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* end user documentation (how to download and install) (**Ciprian, Trond**)
* Contact *Davvi Girji* about cooperation on electronic dictionaries
  (**Sjur**)
* developing the mobile phone version of smenob:
    - http://pfed.info/wksite/
* Komi
    - take out the doublets to a separate file (**Ciprian**)
    - merge the doublets (**Jaska, Trond**)
    - start looking at the komfin and komeng MacDicts (**Ciprian**)
    - Completing the automaton to some state (**Trond, Jaska, Paula**)

# Proofing tools

## South Sámi second alpha

Maja:
* looks good:)
* some words are written correct, but the speller rejects them

Trond:
* a frequent bug was nubpie because of a wrong tag
* speller - analyser diff

Thomas:
* the phonetic rules seem to work now

Tomi:
* baseform test is checking whether the baseforms are recognised by the speller

**TODO:**
* Go through the phonrules file (**Thomas**)
* Pick a text for proofreading (**Thomas**)
* Proofread a text with tre eror$error notation (**Maja**)
* difftest for fst and PL speller (**Sjur**)
* Compile a new version by Friday (**Tomi**)
    - `cd $GTHOME/prooftools/; sudo make mac-dmg`
* Look for external beta testers?
    - David and Jovsset will get the speller, for other people
   we must wait.
* fix the installer build issues (**Sjur**)
* correct easter egg to say "South Sámi", not "North Sámi" (**Sjur**)
* fix sma installer bugs (**Sjur**)

## HFST-based proofing tools

[Voikko](http://voikko.sf.net) will be our near future proofing solution, using HFST as
the language technology core.

Please join the [libvoikko](http://lists.puimula.org/listinfo/libvoikko) mailing list.

One article linked:

[http://voikko.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/voikko/trunk/libvoikko/doc/morphological-analysis.txt]

**TODO:**
* continue to write an API specification, and an implementation specification
  (**Sjur**)

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* test new and nested error markup (**Sjur**)
    - nesting still needs to be tested, depends on new `ccat` feature

### Speller testing

**TODO:**
* test the error type selection feature in ccat (**Sjur**)

### Testing open-source Norwegian spellers

**Sjur** has invited the open-source group to test their spell-checker using our
test bench. The response has been positive, we'll see what happens.

We should go to their developer meetings, and present our work and how to work
with language technology.

## Speller bugs
