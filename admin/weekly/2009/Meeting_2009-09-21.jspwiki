!!!Future plans, directions and ideas

See a separate document in {{plan/strat/5year.jspwiki}}.

!!Northern areas project

__TODO:__
* Attend a beginners' course in Russian (priority: the alphabet!) near you..
* plan a meeting/seminar with potential cooperation partners (__Trond, Sjur__)
* plan for The Real Thing (__Trond, Sjur__)

!!!Infrastructure

To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

# test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
## test bench enhanced, but not yet complet
# set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
## permanent chat rooms
## stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
## iCal server / group calendars
## wiki
# wiki? on G5 (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
# improve Forrest stability and i18n support ( the divvun crashes)
## __Sjur__ has been working on better i18n and pdf rendering
## __Børre__ has some ideas for getting back to serving static html files
# reorganise the documentation:
## differ between target groups
## get better grouping
## decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium|http://www.apertium.org/] and 
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
## update/add missing parts
# migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
## Name lexica (the Name project)
## Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
## At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
# change the look of the documentation web
# use HFST as alternative to XFST
# corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
# update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

Snow Leopard: Sjur has installed it, here are some observations:
* "feels" faster (well, it is real, but no hard figures)
* several command line utilities are updated to recent (newest?) version
* 64-bit all around!

__TODO:__
* ask Lene, Linda to install Mikogo (__Trond__)
* restructure and clean the script catalogue, using subdirs to categorise the
  scripts (__Ciprian__)
** see posting in the news group
* infrastructure remake: (__Børre, Ciprian, Saara, Sjur, Tomi, Trond__)
** more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
** merge gt, kt and st into one
** modularised preprocess and spellrelax
** alternatives to make:
*** [SCons|http://www.scons.org/]
*** [makepp|http://makepp.sourceforge.net/]
*** [Maven|http://maven.apache.org/] (for java-projects)
*** [CMake|http://www.cmake.org/]
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (__Ciprian, Sjur, Trond__)
** delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* define and document testing routines (__Ciprian, Sjur, Trond__)
** delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* test iCal Server (on G5) (__Børre__)

!!!Linguistics

!!North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

!!Lule Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

!!South Sámi

__Maja__ had planned to meet Ove Lorentz last week, but there was no opportunity for  that. Has sent him the draft paper about loan words.

__TODO:__
* reformulate the proper noun grammar according to the Trondheim discussions
  (__Maja, Sjur, Thomas, Trond__)
* Prepare text´s about normativity issue to SGL/SGM (__Maja, Thomas__)
** placenames (__Maja__)
** other issues
* finish the umlaut / derivation work (__Thomas, Sjur, Tomi__)
* adjectives (__Maja__ with __Thomas, Trond, Sjur__)
** two competing naming conventions of continuation lexicons
*** One naming goes ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE
*** One follows the sme convention of naming key adjectives
*** There are duplicate lexica
** The comparative issue open here and there
*** The ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE lexica now go to EVENCOMP and
    ODDCOMP only.

!!!Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

__Tomi__ has played with [couchdb|http://couchdb.apache.org/] as a replacement
for eXist in risten.no and general dictionary-related work. Seems much lighter
and easier to work with.

Instead of building our own webforms and back-end update scripts, use XForms
with a premade connection to our xml db. Orbeon XForms is such a tool (open
source).

From the meeting with the terminology and IT teams last week:
* no major rework on the present search interface now
* no work on the editing section; instead:
* add existing lists of sanctioned terminology as separate term entities
* add a dictionary if we can make one with sufficient quality

This means the following tasks:
* find already approved lists, in paper or electronic form (__term team__)
* convert paper lists to electronic lists (__term team__)
* convert lists to standard XML (__Sjur, Tomi__)
* add prepared lists to risten.no (__Sjur, Tomi__)

__TODO:__
# send eXist log files to Ciprian (__Sjur__)
# fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (__Sjur__)
# fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (__Saara__)
# finish first version of the editing (__Sjur__)
# test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (__Sjur, Thomas, Trond__)
# make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add {{nob}}
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (__Sjur, Saara__)
# convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (__Sjur, Tomi, Saara__)
# implement data synchronisation between [risten.no|http://www.risten.no] and
  the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
  to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
  official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
# start to use the xml file as source file
# clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (__Thomas, linguists__)
# merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (__linguists__)
# publish the name lexicon on risten.no (__Sjur__)
# add missing parallel names for placenames (__linguists__)
# add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (__linguists__)

!!Dictionaries

__TODO:__
* set up risten.no on eXist/XServe (as a beta version site) (__Sjur__)
* set up required infra for smenob on risten.no/XServe (__Sjur__)
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (__Ciprian, Sjur, Trond__)
* end user documentation (how to download and install) (__Ciprian, Trond__)
* Contact ''Davvi Girji'' about cooperation on electronic dictionaries
  (__Sjur__)
* developing the mobile phone version of smenob:
** http://pfed.info/wksite/ 
* Komi
** take out the doublets to a separate file (__Ciprian__)
** merge the doublets (__Jaska, Trond__)
** start looking at the komfin and komeng MacDicts (__Ciprian__)
** Completing the automaton to some state (__Trond, Jaska, Paula__)

!!!Proofing tools

!!HFST-based proofing tools

__TODO:__
* continue to write an API specification, and an implementation specification
  (__Sjur__)

!!Hunspell

__Børre__ has released beta7, with working clitics, negation verb and copula.

!!Testing

!Spelling Error Markup

__TODO:__
* test new and nested error markup (__Sjur__)
** nesting still needs to be tested, depends on new {{ccat}} feature

!Speller testing

__TODO:__
* test the error type selection feature in ccat (__Sjur__)
* package and deliver {{sma}} proofing tools (__Sjur, Tomi__)
* add South Sámi DLL's to the svn repository (__Sjur__)

!Testing open-source Norwegian spellers

__Sjur__ has invited the open-source group to test their spell-checker using our
test bench. The response has been positive, we'll see what happens.

We should go to their developer meetings, and present our work and how to work
with language technology.
