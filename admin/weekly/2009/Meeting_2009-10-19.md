* plan for The Real Thing (**Trond, Sjur**)

# Infrastructure

XServe has now replaced the G5, which turned out to be too unstable. The aliases
`g5` and `xs` both will start an `ssh` connection to the XServe. It serves
as the web server for both [http://divvun.no] and [http://giellatekno.uit.no].

divvun.no is now static HTML files generated by Forrest.

HFST 2.x is now released, and seems to work fine. Some initial quirks have been
worked out.

There are some differences in the lookup output:

```

The hash mark is explained

To accomodate future enhancements in different directions (in rough order of
importance):

1. test bench for all parts of our language technology efforts
    1. test bench enhanced, but not yet complet
1. set up the Leopard Server features for collaborative support:
    1. permanent chat rooms
    1. stored (and indexed) chat transcripts of the chat rooms
    1. iCal server / group calendars
    1. wiki
1. wiki? on G5 (is part of Leopard Server) or other web-based documentation
1. improve Forrest stability and i18n support ( the divvun crashes)
    1. **Sjur** has been working on better i18n and pdf rendering
    1. **Børre** has some ideas for getting back to serving static html files
1. reorganise the documentation:
    1. differ between target groups
    1. get better grouping
    1. decide what to write in forrest and what in wiki
   (cf. [Apertium](http://www.apertium.org/) and
   [http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/apertium/]) for a similar split)
    1. update/add missing parts
1. migrate lexc lexicons to XML, splitting the task
    1. Name lexica (the Name project)
    1. Dictionaries (already in XML, task is to integrate them)
    1. At least migrate the lexc open POSes (Komi as a pilot case)
1. change the look of the documentation web
1. use HFST as alternative to XFST
    1. this is now a real option (HFST2 is released), reqiures Makefile enhancements
1. corpus content moved to Max Planck repositories? Norsk språkbank?
1. update infrastructure to allow content-restricted spellers for special target
  groups

**TODO:**
* phase out the G5, use the XServe as our web server instead (**Børre**)
    - done
* HFST feedback: CG-friendly formatting, to get rid of the lookup2cg script
  (**Sjur, Trond**)
* upgrade the XServe to Snow Leopard Server (**Børre**)
* ask Lene, Linda to install Mikogo (**Trond**)
* restructure and clean the script catalogue, using subdirs to categorise the
  scripts (**Ciprian**)
    - see posting in the news group
* infrastructure remake: (**Børre, Ciprian, Saara, Sjur, Tomi, Trond**)
    - more modularised make / build infra (prepare for smn, sms, sjd, others)
    - merge gt, kt and st into one
    - modularised preprocess and spellrelax
    - alternatives to make:
        - [SCons](http://www.scons.org/)
        - [makepp](http://makepp.sourceforge.net/)
        - [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (for java-projects)
        - [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/)
* make a test-all target that runs all tests we have (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process
* define and document testing routines (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
    - delayed until we have restructured the make/build process

# Linguistics

## North Sámi

(nothing new, see proofing bugs below)

## Lule Sámi

Lene has been working hard on the dis files for smj, because of the upcoming
conference [Lapponic 3](http://www.hum.uit.no/lapponic/). Lexical additions are
welcome, so have a look at a missing list near you, if you feel for it.

## South Sámi

**Maja** wants some help with the loanword text and discussion.

The propernoun analysis should (now when the speller is in an alpha state)
be promoted upwards on our agenda, and propernouns added.

**TODO:**
* Prepare text´s about normativity issue to SGL/SGM (**Maja, Thomas**)
* adjectives (**Maja** with **Thomas, Trond, Sjur**)
    - two competing naming conventions of continuation lexicons
        - One naming goes ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE
        - One follows the sme convention of naming key adjectives
        - There are duplicate lexica
    - The comparative issue open here and there
        - The ATTRSUFF-PREDSUFF-STEMTYPE lexica now go to EVENCOMP and
    ODDCOMP only.
* work meeting on loan words and proper nouns, this week - tomorrow?
  (**Maja, Ove (?), Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)

# Name lexicon/risten.no infrastructure

**Tomi** has played with [couchdb](http://couchdb.apache.org/) as a replacement
for eXist in risten.no and general dictionary-related work. Seems much lighter
and easier to work with.

Instead of building our own webforms and back-end update scripts, use XForms
with a premade connection to our xml db. Orbeon XForms is such a tool (open
source).

From the meeting with the terminology and IT teams last week:
* no major rework on the present search interface now
* no work on the editing section; instead:
* add existing lists of sanctioned terminology as separate term entities
* add a dictionary if we can make one with sufficient quality

This means the following tasks:
* find already approved lists, in paper or electronic form (**term team**)
* convert paper lists to electronic lists (**term team**)
* convert lists to standard XML (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add prepared lists to risten.no (**Sjur, Tomi**)

**TODO:**
1. send eXist log files to Ciprian (**Sjur**)
1. fix i18n bug in risten.no/G5 (so they will work without the proper locale
  request) (**Sjur**)
1. fix bugs in lexc2xml; add comments to the log element (**Saara**)
1. finish first version of the editing (**Sjur**)
1. test editing of the xml files. If ok, then: (**Sjur, Thomas, Trond**)
1. make terms-smX.xml <=== automatically from propernoun-sme-lex.xml (add `nob`
  as well) (the morphological section should be kept intact, in e.g.
  propernoun-sme-morph.txt) (**Sjur, Saara**)
1. convert propernoun-($lang)-lex.txt to a derived file from common xml files
  (**Sjur, Tomi, Saara**)
1. implement data synchronisation between [risten.no](http://www.risten.no) and
  the cvs repo, and possibly other servers (ie the G5 as an alternative server
  to the public risten.no - it might be faster and better suited than the
  official one; also local installations could be treated the same way)
1. start to use the xml file as source file
1. clean terms-sme.xml such that all names have the correct tag for their use
  (e.g. @type=secondary) (**Thomas, linguists**)
1. merge placenames which are errouneously in different entries: e.g. Helsinki,
  Helsingfors, Helsset (**linguists**)
1. publish the name lexicon on risten.no (**Sjur**)
1. add missing parallel names for placenames (**linguists**)
1. add informative links between first names like Niillas and Nils
  (**linguists**)

## Dictionaries

Komi work is progressing. The meeting last week was clarifying. The work on Komi
is also a nice exercise for the make remake task.

Lemma selection on the dictionary for pronouns: Persons as lemma forms, yes,
but not case.

* Person: Separate lemmas
* Number: Separate lemmas (?)
* Case: Not separate lemmas

After Komi & Kildin, Ciprian would like to return to `sma` with some help from
**Maja**.

**TODO:**
* set up risten.no on eXist/XServe (as a beta version site) (**Sjur**)
* set up required infra for smenob on risten.no/XServe (**Sjur**)
* Continue the dictionary infrastructure discussion (**Ciprian, Sjur, Trond**)
* end user documentation (how to download and install) (**Ciprian, Trond**)
* Contact *Davvi Girji* about cooperation on electronic dictionaries
  (**Sjur**)
* developing the mobile phone version of smenob:
    - http://pfed.info/wksite/
* Komi
    - take out the doublets to a separate file (**Ciprian**)
    - merge the doublets (**Jaska, Trond**)
    - start looking at the komfin and komeng MacDicts (**Ciprian**)
    - Completing the automaton to some state (**Trond, Jaska, Paula**)

# Proofing tools

## South Sámi (pre)alpha

Maja:
* inspiration for more work
* also inspiration for correcting spelling errors in existing documents :)
* in most cases the speller seems to work fine for nouns

Trond:
* no phonrule file was used - we want a new version with a somewhat useful
  phonrule file
* No Adp was generated. All Adp are now changed to Po and Pr.
* new version after the loan word and proper noun meeting
* We need a tool to diff the list of unknown words from the fst and PL-speller:
  *staeriesvoetem* is analysed as
  *"staeries" A Attr Der2 Der/voete Sg Acc @OBJ*, but it is not recognised by
  the speller
* we need a test round for this first speller, to define the baseline for the
  development

Thomas:
* many rules in phonrule-file already. We need to check if there is really a
  need for all these rules, too many rules slow down speller, especially general
  rules; test thoroughly without the phon-rules file first!
* specific rules are better than general rules
* letters or letter combinations are more critical in short words than in long
  words, examples: jïh>jih is a short word, åssjalommesh is a little bit longer
  (the speller has not as much choice here, so it will probably find the right
  suggestion sooner)

A rule like the following should not be necessary - simple transpositions like
this is handled quite well by the default speller setup:
```
b>p => bluevie>pluevie, Aarborte>Aarporte
```

**TODO:**
* Go through the phonrules file (**Thomas**)
* Pick a text for proofreading (**Thomas**)
* Proofread a text with tre eror$error notation (**Maja**)
* difftest for fst and PL speller (**Sjur**)
* Compile a new version after some dust has settled (date fixed?) (**Tomi**)
* Look for external beta testers?
    - David and Jovsset will get the speller, for other people
   we must wait.
* fix the installer build issues (**Sjur**)

## HFST-based proofing tools

**TODO:**
* continue to write an API specification, and an implementation specification
  (**Sjur**)

## Hunspell

No further development. See our download page for the latest beta.

## Testing

### Spelling Error Markup

**TODO:**
* test new and nested error markup (**Sjur**)
    - nesting still needs to be tested, depends on new `ccat` feature

### Speller testing

**TODO:**
* test the error type selection feature in ccat (**Sjur**)
* package and deliver `sma` proofing tools (**Sjur, Tomi**)
* add South Sámi DLL's to the svn repository (**Sjur**)

### Testing open-source Norwegian spellers

**Sjur** has invited the open-source group to test their spell-checker using our
test bench. The response has been positive, we'll see what happens.

We should go to their developer meetings, and present our work and how to work
with language technology.

## Speller bugs

List of bugs returned from Polderland:
* 621
* 630
* 652

cand.philol.	cand.philol+ABBR+N+Acc
Per
Per	Per+N+Prop+Mal+Sg+Attr
