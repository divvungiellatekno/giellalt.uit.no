# Divvun Meeting

Til stades: Børre, Maja, Sjur, Thomas, Tomi

Saker:
* since last - *very* short **oral** status reports from everyone, most important things only
* the coming wee

# Since last

## Børre

* Børre has fixed too_low_mainlang errors in freecorpus. These errors belong in two categories: Mixed language in docs and bad language recognizer. The fix for the first case is to move the docs to orig/mixed, the fix for the other is to set the monolingual variable (mostly nno). Down from 620 to 289 errors in this category.
* Meeting about risten2 with Sjur and Tomi.

## Duommá
has struggled with Ávvir-compounds, now only 59 000 left in bound-file.

## Maja Lisa
has worked with adjective- attributes- added some new - need to discuss these further with Duommá, (Lene?) and Trond - two days tilvenning/avvenning in kindergarden.

# The coming week
* adj.-attributt ved nom.ag-derivasjonar (presens partisipp/subst./adj) (**Maja**)
