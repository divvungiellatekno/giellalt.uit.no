Intelligent dictionaries
========================

The goal is to make a dictionary that gives morphological equivalents of
the entries. Thus, in addition to offer 'boahtit' for 'komme (to come)'
(and vice versa), it should also offer 'boađán' for 'jeg kommer (I
come)' (and vice versa).

At the moment, we are working on morphology-aware electronic
dictionaries. The user may click any inflected word in a text, and get
the translation of the corresponding lemma.
