** how much more 

!!!Commented topics

* linguistic issues
** General linguistic discussion (morphology (and syntax?)): 
*** What is on top of the priority list? 
*** What are our most serious problems?
*** What can we learn from each other?
*** How should we work together across the projects in the remaining months?
** Lexical coverage
** 3-part compounds

* lang-tech issues:
** finalise Xerox hyphenation (Trond + Sjur 2-3 timar)
** G3 issue for sme

* technical issues
** The munching deadlock
** M4 macros for hyph/spell/dis versions of TWOL
** our own wiki? for (technical) CG documentation, (open source) fst technology and Sámi language technology (basically the parts of our current documentation that isn't project-specific. Goal: to invite and engage a larger community (CG, fst/transducer users, i.e., the grammatically-based bottum-up parsing community) to improve and create documenation for the above topics. Potential partners are Helsinki, Oslo, Odense, Stuttgart. 

* [speller plans|tromso-2006-08-lexc2xspell.html]
- infra to generate word form lists for Polderland/Aspell/HunSpell type spellers. We need to setle on plans for this infrastructure now.

* Polderland work
** online meeting with them? Yes, [memo available|tromso-2006-08-polderland.html]

* [proper noun status and action plan|tromso-2006-08-propnoun.html]
** action plan: we need to systematically go through the most typical/useful tasks (problem now: Sjur and Tomi do not edit lexicons enough to really know what is most important)
** technical evaluation: how do we make proper noun editing work in Emacs, and who? Are the coding (as in XML tags/structure) solutions good? (speed is not an issue, at least not on my new Mac:-), and shouldn't be on the server either)

Worst-case scenario: The name project failed, took too long time, etc., and we will have to build separate name lexica in traditional lexc format for each language. In the best case we will get it up and running in a reasonable amount of time.

* corpus collection:
** how much more (in terms of effort and invested time)? Børre needs to start looking at testing pretty soon - we should have tools for people to test this fall, and we need a working feedback infra to make sure we get the respons we need
* divvun plans ahead
