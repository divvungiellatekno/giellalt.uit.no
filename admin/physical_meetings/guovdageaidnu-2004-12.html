This is an overview document to collect the most important pieces from
our opening seminar. From here you'll find links to:

-   [the agenda](guovdageaidnu-2004-12-calendar.pdf) (in Norwegian)
-   [the opening presentation](guovdageaidnu-2004-12-opening.pdf) (in
    English)
-   [a presentation of what spellers
    are](guovdageaidnu-2004-12-speller.pdf) (in Norwegian)
-   [project routines](guovdageaidnu-2004-12-routines.pdf) (in English)

It is funny and useful reading comparing the plans (cf. opening
presentation and project routines) with the reality.

The documentation infrastructure was not fully in place ahead of this
meeting, and the documents are therefore non-standard. Another
indication of this early phase is that several of the documents are in
Norwegian.
