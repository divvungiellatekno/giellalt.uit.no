Original plan
=============

The originally planned status for the Divvun project as of beginning
2006 was:

-   aSpell-ALPHA
-   started corpus building
-   contract signed with subcontractor, and cooperation established
-   new, xml-based lexicon format (not really part of the official plan,
    but it was on my whish-list before we start the cooperation with
    external companies)

Relevant for this overview is also the next milestones:

-   **Jul. 1st, 2006::**
    First testversion of Northern Saami and Lule Saami spellchecker for
    office programs (MSOffice-ALPHA, OpenOffice.org-ALPHA), first
    testversion of Northern Saami hyphenator (InDesign-ALPHA). Text
    collection is done.
-   **Jan. 1st, 2007::**
    The second testversions of all the spellcheckers are ready
    (aSpell-BETA, MSOffice-BETA, OpenOffice.org-BETA, InDesign-BETA).
-   **Jul. 1st, 2007::**
    The spellchechers are ready, and version 1.0 is released
    (aSpell-FINAL, MSOffice-FINAL, OpenOffice.org-FINAL,
    InDesign-FINAL).
-   **sep. 30tt, 2007:**
    The project is terminated, all documentation and project information
    is finished and delivered to a permanent maintenance organisation.
    Eventual errors from the 1.0 version are corrected.

Present status
==============

The actual situation is slightly different:

-   DONE:
    -   aSpell-ALPHA
    -   started corpus building (but not as much as planned)
-   NOT DONE:
    -   subcontractor contract and established cooperation
    -   new, xml-based lexicon format (but we are making progress with
        our name lexicon)

General remarks
---------------

-   still delayed by the risten.no work last spring
-   corpus contracts took considerably longer time to finish than
    expected
-   the same is true for the public tender process (which is far from
    finished)
-   it was good to have a goal and deadline for our aSpell-ALPHA, it
    helped us focus and finish in time

Updated milestones
==================

As a consequence of the delays with the subcontractors, we need to
modify our schedule a bit. Here's the suggested changes:

-   **Jul. 1st, 2006::**
    Text collection is done. sme-aSpell-BETA is finished, we open our
    public testing, small-scale as a start, to get some experience and
    feedback on the testing procedure and user experience and
    cooperation. smj-aSpell-ALPHA finished.
-   **Oct. (Nov.?) 1st, 2006::**
    First testversion of Northern Saami and Lule Saami spellchecker for
    office programs (MSOffice-ALPHA, OpenOffice.org-ALPHA), first
    testversion of Northern Saami hyphenator (InDesign-ALPHA).
-   **Feb. 1st, 2007::**
    The second testversions of all the spellcheckers are ready
    (smj-aSpell-BETA, MSOffice-BETA, OpenOffice.org-BETA,

    The spellchechers are ready, and version 1.0 is released
    (aSpell-FINAL, MSOffice-FINAL, OpenOffice.org-FINAL,
