        <li>contract signed with subcontractor, and cooperation
        established</li>

        <li>new, xml-based lexicon format (not really part of the official
        plan, but it was on my whish-list before we start the cooperation with
        external companies)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Relevant for this overview is also the next milestones:</p>

    <section>
      <title>Present status</title>

      <p>The actual situation is slightly different:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>DONE:<ul>
            <li>aSpell-ALPHA</li>

            <li>started corpus building (but not as much as planned)</li>
          </ul></li>

        <li>NOT DONE:<ul>
            <li>subcontractor contract and established cooperation</li>

            <li>new, xml-based lexicon format (but we are making progress with
            our name lexicon)</li>
          </ul></li>
      </ul>

      <section>
        <title>General remarks</title>

        <ul>
          <li>still delayed by the risten.no work last spring</li>

          <li>corpus contracts took considerably longer time to finish than
          expected</li>

          <li>the same is true for the public tender process (which is far
          from finished)</li>

          <li>it was good to have a goal and deadline for our aSpell-ALPHA, it
          helped us focus and finish in time</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

    <section>

        <dd>Text collection is done. sme-aSpell-BETA is finished, we open our
        public testing, small-scale as a start, to get some experience and
        feedback on the testing procedure and user experience and cooperation.
