      <p>This is an overview document to collect the most important pieces from
      our opening seminar. From here you'll find links to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="guovdageaidnu-2004-12-calendar.pdf">the agenda</a> (in
            Norwegian)</li>
        <li><a href="guovdageaidnu-2004-12-opening.pdf" >the opening
            presentation</a> (in English)</li>
        <li><a href="guovdageaidnu-2004-12-speller.pdf" >a presentation of what
            spellers are</a> (in Norwegian)</li>
        <li><a href="guovdageaidnu-2004-12-routines.pdf">project routines</a>
            (in English)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It is funny and useful reading comparing the plans (cf. opening
      presentation and project routines) with the reality.</p>

      <note>The documentation infrastructure was not fully in place ahead of
      this meeting, and the documents are therefore non-standard. Another
      indication of this early phase is that several of the documents are in
      Norwegian.</note>
