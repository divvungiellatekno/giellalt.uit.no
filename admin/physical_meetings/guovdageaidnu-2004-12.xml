      <p>This is an overview document to collect the most important pieces from
         our opening seminar. From here you'll find links to:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li><a href="guovdageaidnu-2004-12-calendar.pdf">the agenda</a> (in
            Norwegian)
         </li>
         <li><a href="guovdageaidnu-2004-12-opening.pdf">the opening
               presentation</a> (in English)
         </li>
         <li><a href="guovdageaidnu-2004-12-speller.pdf">a presentation of what
               spellers are</a> (in Norwegian)
         </li>
         <li><a href="guovdageaidnu-2004-12-routines.pdf">project routines</a>
            (in English)
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is funny and useful reading comparing the plans (cf. opening
         presentation and project routines) with the reality.
      </p>
      <note>The documentation infrastructure was not fully in place ahead of
         this meeting, and the documents are therefore non-standard. Another
         indication of this early phase is that several of the documents are in
         Norwegian.
