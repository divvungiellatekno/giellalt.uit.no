!!!Divvun/Disamb Seminar in Tromsø

* project meeting
**  date: 23. (after lunch) - 26. (Friday is travelling day) January.
**  place: Tromsø

* Participants
** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday: Børre, Ilona, Linda, Saara, Sjur, Tomi, Trond  
** Thursday: Børre, Ilona, Linda, Sjur, Tomi, Trond
  
* Practical arrangements:
** Room(s): The meeting is at room 4475, with room 4402 as alternating room. 
  Both rooms are situated in the same floor as our offices.
*** We have one projector, and perhaps a possibility to hire another one.
*** 4475 has internet, but no whiteboard, and 4402 has whitebord, but not internet.
*** TODO: Get hold of a flipover for 4475.
*** TODO: Lunch only for 7 persons
*** TODO: Machine for Ilona at 10.00.
** Lunch will be in Sjampanjekantina, 11.30, Monday to Thursday.
** Coffee breaks are not arranged, we may order them from the canteen, or 
   we may buy it ourselves.
** hotel = Thon Polar Hotel, Grønnegata 45 (Saara, Ilona, Linda, Sjur)

Suggested content that's still not scheduled:

* Programmers
** Work distribution (in bug fixing, documentation, maintenance etc.)
*** Not done
** Parallel corpora and the corpus infrastructure
*** Discussions and clarifications, planned a trip to Oslo, no concrete work
** xml2lexc implementation plan
*** Not done (much done earlier, though)
** file-specific xsl scripts for corpus conversions, the what, how and who issues
   (t: Saara/Tomi; p: Trond, Børre, Sjur)
*** Saara has demoed her work, with eager support of Tomi and Børre, we have thus
    got some insight in what to do and how. Our xsl scripts cannot do much heavy
    work, though, they remain on the metalevel (modifying the header rather than 
    the body).

* Linguists
** Two linguists were missing, so not too much linguistics was discussed, but some.
** Get together and discuss common issues
*** Done
** Approaches to working with the lexicon
*** We are wiser now. (or are we?)
** Tags
*** All too short discussion with the Saami dept, but at least it clarified our own
    thoughts. They promised to look at the tags and their usefulness. The indefinite pronoun
    question remains open.
** Substandard forms
*** Not done.
** The numeral projects
*** Progress made:
*** For the arabic part, num.fst is now integrated into sme.fst. It needs refinement, 
    though.
*** For the linguistic part, we did some fieldwork with an innocent informant (Tomi).
** Twol issues
*** Not touched.
** Unix etc. courses.
*** Kept a 45 min unix course, useful. Still more hints to pick up, though, but ok that 
    the hints are presented in palatable portions. Conclusion: Have a unix session at the 
    next meeting as well, or perhaps unix course sessions online, next week etc.

* All
** how to correctly write Forrest documentation
*** site.xml (what is it, how do we add to it?)
*** site-frag.xml (what's the difference?)
** testing - how-to, improvements
** code style guidelines

!!!Schedule

Aims:
* a mixture of training/discussions and practical work, to avoid monotonicity
* most training in the beginning, as preparations for later work
** The schedule never recovered from the changing participant number (-2, +1, -1, etc.),
   but nevertheless we had a good workmeeting.

! Summary

We have seen important progress in some but very limited fields, but there are still
open issues.

Evaluated against our expectations the week was too short.

One lesson to learn is that we should have met better prepared, we should have gone 
through the issues in beforehand, so that we could concentrate upon the really hard 
problems.

It was nice to meet face to face, both for the first time, and for the 
long-time-no-see factor.
