      <h1>Original plan</h1>
      <p>The originally planned status for the Divvun project as of beginning
         2006 was:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>aSpell-ALPHA</li>
         <li>started corpus building</li>
         <li>contract signed with subcontractor, and cooperation
            established
         </li>
         <li>new, xml-based lexicon format (not really part of the official
            plan, but it was on my whish-list before we start the cooperation with
            external companies)
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Relevant for this overview is also the next milestones:</p>

         <li><strong>Jan. 1st, 2007::
               </strong><br>The second testversions of all the spellcheckers are ready
            (aSpell-BETA, MSOffice-BETA, OpenOffice.org-BETA, InDesign-BETA).
         </li>
         <li><strong>Jul. 1st, 2007::
               </strong><br>The spellchechers are ready, and version 1.0 is released

         </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Present status</h1>
      <p>The actual situation is slightly different:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>DONE:
            <ul>
               <li>aSpell-ALPHA</li>
               <li>started corpus building (but not as much as planned)</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>NOT DONE:
            <ul>
               <li>subcontractor contract and established cooperation</li>
               <li>new, xml-based lexicon format (but we are making progress with
                  our name lexicon)
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>General remarks</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>still delayed by the risten.no work last spring</li>
         <li>corpus contracts took considerably longer time to finish than
            expected
         </li>
         <li>the same is true for the public tender process (which is far
            from finished)
         </li>
         <li>it was good to have a goal and deadline for our aSpell-ALPHA, it
            helped us focus and finish in time
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Updated milestones</h1>
      <p>As a consequence of the delays with the subcontractors, we need to
         modify our schedule a bit. Here's the suggested changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Jul. 1st, 2006::
               </strong><br>Text collection is done. sme-aSpell-BETA is finished, we open our
            public testing, small-scale as a start, to get some experience and
            feedback on the testing procedure and user experience and cooperation.
