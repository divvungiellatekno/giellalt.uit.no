# Wish list for project management tools

* cheap :-)
* integration with OS X:
    - iCal:
        - the best option would be two-way integration/synchronisation of iCals,
    such that when tasks are marked as completed in iCal (or another ical
    application), the project management software would pick this up and update
    the project status similarly
    - Spotlight:
   ability to search (all) the content of project files, such as dates,
   resources, tasks, etc.
    - Mail:
        - automatically send mails at defined events (although this could just as
    easily be done via the calendar application)
        - manually send mails to resources from actions, tasks, etc. with filled-in
    action, task etc. info
    - Address Book
        - resources should be taken from the address book, as well as e-mail
    addresses,
    - (even) more is better
* scheduled, revised and actual performance
* subprojects/superprojects
* import/export of MS Project + XML format; more is better
* useful defaults or good templates
* clear organisation/layout of views
* low barrier to enter (especially for newcomers)
* time and task reporting by team members
* integrated risk management
* requirements specification tied to tasks and milestones
  (internal or interactively from another app)
* each requirement should be expressable as a test case with acceptance
  limits; the test case should be exportable/integratable with a real
  test environment (problem: many of our tests may not be standardised or
  standardisable to software development tools - namely the linguistic
  testing)
* integration with bugtracking system

# Project management tools for MacOS X:

##  FastTrack Schedule 8 (FTS)
* [Home page](http://www.aecsoftware.com/Default.asp?bhcp=1)
* Price: XXX (already bought)
* OS X integration:
    - not too impressive. It is a cross-platform product (Win/Mac), with the
   constraints regarding proper integration that typically follows from that.
* scheduling:
    - standard; there's a lot of possibilities in there, and FTS has many fancy
   tools and dialogues to adjust existing and create new types of schedules and
   dependencies. This comes at the cost of an unwieldy interface, and a lot of
   work to get a reasonable standard setup in place (and quite ugly bars)
* subprojects:
    - FTS supports nested tasks, but has no notion of projects within projects.
   Also, each project is a separate file, and linking and resource sharing among
   projects is not possible, as far as I can tell.
* import/export:
    - can import and export to the most central formats
* defaults and templates:
    - not impressive
* visual organisation and presentation:
    - a lot of Windows in the UI, and the UI feels cluttered and overused.
* barrier to enter:
    - relatively high, based on some tests
* reporting
* risk management:
    - nothing (the word *risk* isn't found in the index of the user manual, and
   not by grepping for the same string in the user documentation either)
* requirements specification:
    - has no built-in provision for it
* requirements tied to testing:
    - has no built-in provision for it
* other pluses:
    - seems fast
* other minuses:
* conclusion:
    - Although we have paid for it already, recent development within the Mac
   community makes FTS look less and less attractive. 2 years ago there were no
   real competitors to FTS, but today the situation is almost radically
   different. This is also the reason for the new look into this software
   category before we start project management for real.

##  Merlin 1.3.6
* [Home page](http://www.projectwizards.net/en/merlin)
* Price:  145,- EUR
* OS X integration:
    - Mail
    - AddressBook
    - SpotLight
    - iCal
    - iChat?
* scheduling:
    - standard
* subprojects:
    - at least multiple projects are supported
    - also subtasks are supported, in practice creating the project
   hierarchy we need
    - no support for cross-linking between projects, but see below
    - no support for resource sharing among projects, but see below
* import/export:
    - the native file format is XML (not a good one: Apple's property list format)
    - can export to some basic formats
    - can import a couple more
* defaults and templates:
    - templates: ok
    - defaults: quite good
* visual organisation and presentation:
    - clear OS X style
* barrier to enter:
    - good integration with OS X, reuse of resources and standard GUI
    - Still a lot to learn
* reporting hours and tasks
    - this software is *not* multiuser or server-client-based, and thus requires
   all users to have one licensed copy if they want to edit the files, e.g. for
   entering task status, or to physically access one shared computer (but see
   below)
* risk management:
    - one of the advertised strengths of the application
* requirements specification:
    - not really integrated, but can be specified through so-called elements
* requirements tied to testing:
    - it is possible to export an item list Element to XML, which can then be
   converted to some test file. The potential is there, but it is very
   cumbersome.
* other pluses:
    - speedy
* other minuses:
* conclusion:
    - So far the best application tested, despite the drawbacks. I've received
   feedback that most of our concerns will be targeted by the next major release
   early next year.
