!!!Conversion status

!!What is (not) included

In prestable:

* included in sme: admin/ facta/ laws/
* at least 85 % analysable by the main language analyser - this percentage is
  based on inspection of texts
* parallel documents with at least 30 words, and where the word count diff
  between the parallel docs are between 73% and 110%
* all parallel pointers are ok (in all directions)

Here we count sme words.

Prestable total is 1 612 856.

This is enough to start doing sentence alignment, but it also shows that there
is quite a lot that is NOT yet good enough for (automatic) inclusion in
prestable.

!!What does it look like

!Document structure

Law bug still open.

!Text 

For sme, ligatures represent 400 errors. Others?

Of 1.6 mill words, appr. 1/3 is pdf.

All words divided in pdf are still lost.

Sjur and Trond to look at all-caps xfst script.

Do not forget this conversion error (missing __đ__):
''Vuo oskuvlla ja joatkkaoahpahusa oktasaš''

!!!Next tasks

!!Sentence alignment

Børre has initiated the parallelisation of the entire prestable parallelised corpus.
TCA2 was run with default sentences, and the anchor file in GTHOME/common/.

!!!Targets

* forvaltningsordbok
* Autshumato/translation memory

{{{
cd GTLANG/st/nob/src
make abbr
and that's it.
cat nobtext | preprocess --abbr=st/nob/bin/abbr.txt
}}}


!!!Todo

* sentence alignment (already started) (__Børre__)
** The files are in {{/home/boerre/freecorpus/tmp}}
* testing the alignment output (__Berit Merete, Børre__)
* nob morphological analysis, look at ob.fst vs. nob.fst (__Trond, Sjur__)
* Look through [list of TCA2 improvements|http://giellatekno.uit.no/doc/tools/tca2.html]
* Improve anchor file.
* Parallellised corpus to tmx (__Ciprian, Børre__)
* giza / word aligment incl. documentation of the process (__Trond, Francis__)
* pdf conversion improvements, incl. hyphenation (__Børre__)
* improving conversion of dirty documents (__Børre__)

!!!Milestones

* __8.11.__ First sentence parallellisation done
* __11.11.__ Testing first sentence parallellisation
* __11.11.__ Improve document conversion (?) and sentence parallellisation
** Issues: Ligature, Hyphens, others… 
* Improve nob fst
** __11.11.__ Status quo and some attempts to improvements
*** Choose between ob.fst and nob.fst
*** Look at missing, add words
*** Look at compounding
** __Before Giza:__ Deliver a for-now optimal fst for nob.
* __Before Giza:__ Convert xml parallel to tmx.
* Set up giza
* First word parallellisation
* Testing


!!!Next meeting

Friday at 10.
