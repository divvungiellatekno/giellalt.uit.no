This workshop provides a platform for works on:

# Scope

While we invite for papers on high and middle resource languages, we are especially looking forward to papers targeting under-resourced or less-resourced languages. 

There will also be room for methodological contributions on the FST and CG formalisms themselves regarding either their expressive power or improvements in compiler implementation.
