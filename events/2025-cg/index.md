# Call for Papers


We are happy to announce that our workshop has been accepted to the [Nodalida/Baltic-HLT conference 2025 (March 2-5,2025) in Tallinn, Estonia](https://www.nodalida-bhlt2025.eu).

We welcome all papers on Constraint Grammar and Finite State NLP, including rule-based and hybrid methods, tools and applications.

Traditionally, there has always been a strong user-oriented focus in the Constraint Grammar and Finite State Transducer communities. We would like to strengthen this work by providing a venue for their developers and researchers. In practice, NLP is nothing without its users, nevertheless most of the work presented in international conferences does not even mention a group of users or the reception of the tools. We therefore consider it important to continue the long work being done in this field and make the user aspect of NLP more visible in our workshop. Both applications and new methods that benefit a large user community of low, middle and high resource languages are intended to be the focus of this year's workshop.

We hope to cover not only the traditional field of NLP (morphological, syntactic and semantic analysis), but also the growing plethora of applicational work, where CG and FST provide an important part of end user-oriented systems in various areas of language technology. Those are spelling, grammar and comma correction, CALL, machine translation, speech technology, lexicography, corpus-based sociolinguistics and literary studies, and others. We call for papers on both rule-based and hybrid systems.

While we invite for papers on high and middle resource languages, we are especially looking forward to papers targeting under-resourced or less-resourced languages. There will also be room for methodological contributions on the FST and CG formalisms themselves regarding either their expressive power or improvements in compiler implementation.

The workshop will be organized as a full-day, on-site only event on March 5. All contributions will be peer-reviewed and published as a NoDaLiDa proceedings volume.

## Timeline

All times end of day in [the AoE timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe).

* Submission deadline: ~~December 16th,~~December 22nd, 2024
* Camera-readies: February 3th, 2025
* Workshop: March 5th, 2025


## Submission of papers

Submission is done through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NoDaLiDa/Baltic-HLT/2025/Workshop/CG-FST_NLP).

All submissions must follow the NoDaLiDa 2025 style files, which will be available for LaTeX (preferred) and MS Word and can be retrieved [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VuzuZ-KwJ5zOV7RPsbuje7hRMSN1EfwC/view).
You can also directly open [the Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-nodalida-baltic-hlt-2025-submissions/vntbxsmmzyqj).

Submissions must be anonymous, i.e. not reveal author(s) on the title page or through self-references. Papers must be submitted digitally, in PDF, and uploaded through the online conference system. Paper submissions that violate either of these requirements will be returned without review.

The page limits for submissions are: up to eight pages for regular papers and up to four pages for short papers and demo papers. For all three submission types, these page limits do not include additional pages with bibliographic references. We do not allow any extra pages for appendices.


We invite paper submissions of three types:

1. regular papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research, including empirical evaluation results, where appropriate;
2. short papers on smaller, focused contributions, work in progress, negative results, surveys, or opinion pieces; and
3. demonstration papers on software or resource demonstrations, e.g. of systems, interfaces, infrastructures, data collections, or annotations. Demonstration papers do not need to be anonymous, and will not be published in the proceedings afterwards.
They will be made available on the workshop site.

Submission

The submission itself will be done via **OpenReview**.
