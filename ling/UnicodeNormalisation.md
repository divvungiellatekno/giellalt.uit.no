(*or: how to fix decomposed Sami letters*)

In Unicode, many glyphs (letter symbols) may either be represented
by one character, or by a sequence of many. The letter á may thus be
either one character á or two characters a and combining ´ . Normalisation
forms are used to standardise the representation.

1. NFKD = Normalization Form Compatibility Decomposition
1. NFKC = Normalization Form Compatibility Composition

The first, NFKD, **decomposes** the characters (á as two characters),
whereas the second, NFKC, **composes it** (á as one character).

Our North Sami analysers use the **composed** representation.

If you get text with decomposed letters (**UnicodeChecker** will tell you that č is two characters), you must **compose** them with the following command

```
cat infile.txt \
|  uconv -f utf8 -t utf8 -x Any-NFKC > outfile.txt
```

See also `man uconv`

The uconv program should be installed on your machine as part of
the ICU installation.
