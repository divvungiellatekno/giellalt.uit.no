      <title>The &lt;Correct!&gt; corpora</title>
      <p>The catalogue gt/sme/corp/ now contains a separate directory correct/.</p>
      <p>This directory is meant to contain files marked with &lt;Correct!> tags. Corpus files included here should preferably be stable and corrected for formatting and typographical errors before we embark on the job of marking them with correct tags.</p>
      <p>The files are taken from the corpus files, thus, for any file named filename.txt in the corp/ directory, we may make a file corr-filename.txt in the correct directory. If the original filename.txt is corrected after the corr-filename.txt is made, the correction should probably be done in corr-filename.txt as well.</p>
      <p>Documentation for using the corr-* files can be found on the documentation pages for vislcg.</p>
