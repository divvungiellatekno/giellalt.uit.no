# Testing our grammatical tools

This document contains an overview of the testing suits we have for our different analysers.

Exchange xxx with the language code in question.
$TARGET is the directory of the language, e.g. gt/sme, for sme.

# Testing morphological tools

## Morphophonology

cd $TARGET/testing && make pair-test

## Selftest

Does the analyser recognise all entries in the lexicon?

```
cd gt/
make selftest
```

(Here we might have a look at the Book.)

# Testing proofing tools

When testing proofing tools, it is possible to choose between different engines,
such as the Polderland command-line speller (default speller engine), the
command-line interface to hunspell, etc. The available engines are listed below under each proofing tool section.

## Speller testing

```gt$ make spelltest TARGET=xxx [TESTTOOL=yy] [DATE=ddmmyyyy]```

Available speller engines:

* hu - hunspell
* pl - Polderland command line (default)
* mw - Microsoft Word through AppleScript

### Regression test

### Baseform test

### Typos test

### Correct-corpus test

## Hyphenator testing

```gt$ make hyphtest TARGET=xxx```

### Hyphenator regression testing

To only test regressions, do:

```gt$ make hyphregression TARGET=xxx [TESTTOOL=yy]
```

# Testing syntactic analysis

To run all syntactic tests:

gt$ make cgtests TARGET=xxx

Note that this test cannot be run on victorio (unless you modify the gt Makefile).

## Morphological analysis consistence test

-- not yet written --

## Disambiguator test

gt$ make distest TARGET=xxx

## Dependency test

make deptest
