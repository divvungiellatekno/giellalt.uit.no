Our disambiguator: vislcg3
==========================

The project uses Eckhard Bick and Tino Dideriksens **vislcg3**, a
compiler for constraint grammar, a formalism originally developed by
a.o. Fred Karlsson and Pasi Tapanainen at the University of Helsinki.
Cf. our introduction to [how to write disambiguation
files](cgii-writing.html)

We have developed grammars (=files) for morphological disambiguation
(disambiguation.cg3) syntactic function assignment (functions.cg3) and
dependency assignment (dependency.cg3) for many of the languages we are
working with. Have a look at [the documentation pages for each
individual language](../lang/index.html). For each language, the **What
is This** link will indicate how much work has been done on the language
in question.

The three generations of constraint grammar parsers
---------------------------------------------------

1.  **The original CG formalism** was developed by Fred Karlsson, at
    [Dept. of Linguistics in Helsinki](http://www.ling.helsinki.fi), it
    is presented in Karlsson et al. 1995.
2.  A new version of CG, called **CG-2**, was developed by Pasi
    Tapanainen, cf. Tapanainen 1996. It is maintained by
    [Connexor](http://www.connexor.com). vislcg, an open source
    implementation of CG-2, at <https://visl.sdu.dk/>. This
    parser is available for download ad sourceforge,
    [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/vislcg/), but not maintained
    any more.
3.  **vislcg3**, the third generation of CG compilers, is being
    developed at <https://visl.sdu.dk/>.
