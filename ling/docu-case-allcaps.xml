      <title>Capitalisation</title>
      <p>Here, we document two processes, one accepting initial capitalisation (&quot;Dat&quot; as well as &quot;dat&quot;), and the other one full capitalisation (&quot;DAT&quot; but not &quot;DAt&quot;)</p>

        <title id="ini" >Initial capitalization</title>
        <p>This is what the book says:</p>
        <source>xfst[]: define initcap a (->) A, b (->) B, c (->) C,
d (->) D, e (->) E, f (->) F, g (->) G, h (->) H, i (->) I,
j (->) J, k (->) K, l (->) L, m (->) M, n (->) N, o (->) O,
p (->) P, q (->) Q, r (->) R, s (->) S, t (->) T, u (->) U,
v (->) V, w (->) W, x (->) X, y (->) Y, z (->) Z || .#. _ ;
</source>
        <p>
          This string has been put in the file case.regex, and compiled to
          caseconv.fst using xfst. As a result all initial caps are downcased,
          but upon generation all words are given an alternative reading with
          an initial capital letter. This is not what we want.</p>
      </section>

        <p>The key file is <code>allcaps.regex</code>. It is modelled after the book, and works in the following way:</p>
        <p>First, 'upper' is defined as the set of all capital letters. Then,
allacaps is defined as the set of relations 'a (->) A' etc. for all
small/capital pairs that occur in the context '.#. upper* _ upper* .#.', i.e.
between strings of upper case letters only.</p>
        <p>The resulting binary files <em>allcaps.fst</em> is compiled by the
Makefile. In principle, the parser sme.fst could have been composed with
allcaps.fst into a single transducer (sme.fst .o. allcaps.fst), but this is
not done, since the resulting transducer would have been very large indeed
(cf. discussion on this issue in the book). Instead, the issue is handled in
a <em>lookup script file</em>. Ath present, this file looks as follows (cf.
the discussion on lookup script files in the book):</p>
        <note>Er dette rett?</note>
        <source>analyzer $HOME/gt/sme/bin/sme.fst
allcaps         $HOME/gt/sme/bin/allcaps.fst

allcaps analyzer
</source>
        <p>The lookup script should be used as follows (when standing in sme/):</p>
        <source>.. | lookup -flags mbTT -f src/cap-sme | ...</source>
        <p>Note that the files have absolute, and not relative reference
          (relative reference would here have been <code>../bin/sme.fst</code>
etc.). Xerox has been notified, and has
answered, cf.</p>

        <p>Trond,</p>
        <p>There is some possibility of using Unix environment variables in lookup, see</p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.xrce.xerox.com/competencies/content-analysis/fssoft/docs/lookup-97/lookup97.html" >http://www.xrce.xerox.com/competencies/content-analysis/fssoft/docs/lookup-97/lookup97.html</a>
        </p>
        <p>It may not solve your problem - but please read it first: towards the end, there is reference to environment variables like</p>
        <p>setenv LOOKUP_SCRIPT_BASE ...</p>
        <p>If it is not of enough then the interface should be improved. While it is not a complicated matter, we are short of able people now so you may have to use the full pathnames in your scripts until it gets improved.<br/>(end of quote)</p>
