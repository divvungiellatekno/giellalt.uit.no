# Intro


The Language Archive (TLA) is a unit of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen/The Netherlands working, among other things, with archiving resources on endangered languages and cultures.


The [Freiburg-based documentation projects](freiburg.html) archive their video and audio ressources along with metadata at TLA.
