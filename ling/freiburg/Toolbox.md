# Toolbox

This page documents conventions, standards and relevant workflows used for the annotation of the [Freiburg-Tromsø Speech Corpora](freiburg.html) with the help of the software Toolbox.


Whereas we focus on working with the [FST analyzer](FST.html), parts of our [ELAN corpora](ELAN.html) are being analyzed by external collaboration projects using Toolbox.




# Intro


Toolbox (The Field Linguist’s Toolbox) is a data management and analysis tool used by many field linguists. Among other things, it can parse and interlinearize text. Here are the [Toolbox Documentation Pages](http://www-01.sil.org/computing/catalog/show_software.asp?id=79).




# Workflows


ELAN-->Toolbox-->ELAN

For a way to do this, see:

- [Simon Devylder & Lucie Laporte-Devylder: ELAN -> Toolbox -> ELAN WORKFLOW](METHOD01_ELAN_Toolbox_workflow_Interactive_Speech_Glossing.pdf)




# Scripts


- sending ELAN-data to Toolbox
- sending analyzed Toolbox-data back to ELAN
