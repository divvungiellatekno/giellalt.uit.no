      <title>Introduction</title>

      <p>This document describes the overall process of processing the xml
      corpus into plain text for the needs of testing the languega tools.</p>

      <p><code>catxml</code> is a perl script that takes either a file(s) or a
      directory as input and outputs plain text. It has a funtionality to
      include certain xml elements in output or it can be used to produce an
      analysis of the corpus text.</p>

      <title>ccat</title>

      <p>ccat replaces the catxml-script. It is now installed in victorio to
      <code>/usr/local/bin </code>so you may try it out. All the relevant
      functionality is not yet implemented, such as selecting the language of
      the text. The -analyze option which was present in catxml is not
      implemented either. The basic function of ccat is to print paragraphs
      that have text type (empty type in our xml-files), that is the default.
      In addition to text paragraphs, it is possible to print titles, lists
      and tables and to traverse directories recursively. Usage: </p>

      <source>    Usage: ccat &lt;options&gt; [FileName]
    Print the contents of a corpus file in XML format.
    The default is to print paragraphs with no type (=text type).
    The possible options include:
        -a              Print all text elements.
        -p              Print plain paragraphs. (default)
        -T              Print paragraphs with title type.
        -L              Print paragraphs with list type.
        -t              Print paragraphs with table type.
        -r &lt;dir&gt;        Recursively process directory dir and subdirs enountered.
        -h              Print this help message.
</source>

      <p>The basic type of usage is for example to print out the contents of
      text paragraphs in all the files under
      /usr/local/share/corp/gt/sme/admin/:</p>

      <source>    $ ccat -r /usr/local/share/corp/gt/sme/admin</source>

      <p>If you want to use ccat in your own computer do the following: </p>

      <source>    $ cvs co gt
    $ cd gt/script/samiXMLparser/
    $ make
    $ cp ccat ~/bin/
</source>

      <p>Assuming that you have bin directory under your home directory, and
      it is along PATH. The program is under development, so you will be later
      asked to update your version of the ccat.</p>
