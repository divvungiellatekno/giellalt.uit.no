# Overview

Giellatekno contributes to a various degree in different spoken corpus projects:


* the LIA Sápmi project with UiO
* Komi corpus work with Freiburg and Helsinki
* Pite Sámi work with Joshua Wilbur
* North, Inari and Skolt Saami spoken corpus in Oulu


Common for these is that annotation is done with the help of
Giellatekno analysers. These pages document how this is done.
