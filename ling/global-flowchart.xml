      <title>A flowchart of the parsing process</title>

      <source>        Action taken..              ..by the means of the command:
        **************            ******************************

    |--------------------|
    | take incoming text |        sme$ cat corp/filename.txt |
    |--------------------|
             \/
 |--------------------------|
 | preprocessing it:        |
 | moving one word per line,|     preprocess --abbr=bin/abbr.txt |
 | finding sentence bound.  |
 |--------------------------|
             \/
|-----------------------------|
| morphological analysis:     |
| give each word all possible |   lookup -flags mbTT -utf8 bin/sme.fst |
| analyses                    |
|-----------------------------|
             \/
|-----------------------------|
| processing the output into  |
| a format that fits the dis- |   lookup2cg |
| ambiguator, w/a perlscript  |
|-----------------------------|
             \/
|------------------------------|
| adding syntactic tags        |
| disambiguating the m-analysis|
| picking only the relevant    |   vislcg3 --g src/sme-dis.rle
| morphological analyses.      |
| disambiguating the s-analysis|
|------------------------------|

</source>

      <p>Starting in May 2005, the file vislcg also assigns syntactic tags,
      and at the end of the file it also disambiguate them.</p>

      <p>In order for the command to work, one must stand in the sme (etc.)
      directory. The files are in different directories, for the following
      reasons:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The text file is in the corp directory (any text can be used)</li>

        <li>Starting in june 2005, our new xml corpus is in a separate corp
        directory, not in cvs.</li>

        <li>The binary files (the files that are compiled) are in the bin
        directory</li>

        <li>The lookup2cg script is a perlscript, common to all languages, and
        hence in the ../script directory</li>

        <li>The .rle file is a source file, it is not compiled, and it is
        hence in the src directory</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Hmm, one could perhaps claim that this is somewhat confusing</p>
