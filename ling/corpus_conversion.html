      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
         This file provides an overview of the <a href="CorpusTools.html#convert2xml">corpus conversion process</a>.
         Basically, when a new document is recieved, it is classified according
         to the language and genre and stored as such to the directory structure
         for the original files. All the original files are left untouched. The
         text and structural information contained in the document is extracted
         by a conversion script and transformed to an xml-file. Xml-files are
         stored in separate, parallel directory hierarchy where they can be
         easily accessed and used as a test material for grammar checkers and
         spellers. The metainformation associated with the document, such as the
         name of the author, is stored in an xsl-file and appended to the
         xml-file during the conversion. The metainformation is used elsewhere,
         in different corpus applications.
