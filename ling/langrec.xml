    <abstract>To be able to identify sections within a document not in the
    main language, we need automatic language reqognition. We have now
    installed an open-source package that performs such a task, and this page
    documents its usage and origin.</abstract>

      <title>Source</title>

      <p>The home page of the package TextCat is found at several locations.</p>
 <ul>
<li>
 <a
      href="http://odur.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/TextCat/">The original page at University of
      Groningen</a>, with  <a
      href="http://odur.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/TextCat/text_cat.tgz">the source code </a>. The package is lisenced under a GPL license — see the home
      page for details — and it is developed by Gertjan van Noord</li>
<li><a href="https://victorio.uit.no/langtech/trunk/tools/lang-guesser/">The source code is also available in the Giellatekno repository</a></li>
</ul>
      <p>. The Groningen home  page also
      includes links to a background article, a list of supported languages
      coming with the tools, and also a list of competitors. Here's also
      another <a
      href="http://odur.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/TextCat/Demo/textcat.html">link
      to a demo page</a>, with e-mail address of the author.</p>

    <section>
      <title>Usage</title>

      <p>The tool text_cat itself is installed in <code>gt/scripts/</code>, and basic usage is
      explained by:</p>

      <source>text_cat -h</source>

      <p>Typical usage will be something like:</p>

      <source>text_cat -l "What language is this"</source>

      <p>Or:</p>

      <source>text_cat &lt;input-file&gt;</source>

      <p>In both cases <code>text_cat</code> will return one or more strings
      with the name of the language(s) the script believes the text to be
      in.</p>

      <title>Adding a new recognizable language</title>

      <p>The text_cat reference files are stored in $GTHOME/tools/lang-guesser.</p>

<p>Adding a new language to be recognized requires a suitable training
      corpus to be built. This is most easily done with the accompanying tool
      <code>random_lines</code>:</p>

      <source>&gt;$ random_lines &lt; some-text-file &gt; ShortTexts/language-name.txt</source>

      <p>This commando extracts random lines of text from the input file, and
      stores them in the output file. It also cleans the file a bit. The file
      created is used to build a language model like this:</p>

      <source>&gt;$ text_cat -n &lt; ShortTexts/language-name.txt &gt; LM/language-name.lm</source>

      <p>After this, the language recognition tool <code>text_cat</code> is
      ready for use with another language as shown in the previous
      section.</p>
