The &lt;Correct!&gt; corpora
============================

The catalogue gt/sme/corp/ now contains a separate directory correct/.

This directory is meant to contain files marked with &lt;Correct!&gt;
tags. Corpus files included here should preferably be stable and
corrected for formatting and typographical errors before we embark on
the job of marking them with correct tags.

The files are taken from the corpus files, thus, for any file named
filename.txt in the corp/ directory, we may make a file
corr-filename.txt in the correct directory. If the original filename.txt
is corrected after the corr-filename.txt is made, the correction should
probably be done in corr-filename.txt as well.

Documentation for using the corr-\* files can be found on the
documentation pages for vislcg.
