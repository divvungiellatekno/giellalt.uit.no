      <h1 id="overview">Overview and introduction</h1>
      <p>The bibles are an important source of text in a language. It is even
         more imprtant source of parallel text, since the bible translations
         generally preserve the format of the text irrespectible of the target
         language. In this project, we have recieved bible texts for North and
         Lule Sámi, Bokmål, Nynorsk, Swedish and Finnish. Since the bibles have a
         specific format which requires separate processing than the other files,
         there is a documentation included.
      </p>
      <h1 id="database">Bible as a text source</h1>
      <p>In general..</p>
      <p>The bible files are part of the general conversion process, which is
         described in the documents<a href="corpus_conversion.html">corpus_conversion.html</a> and <a href="corpus_conversion_tech.html">corpus_conversion_tech.html. </a>This
         conversion process is aimed to produce texts that are ready for
         linguistic analysis and research. The texts contain some structure, such
         as the sections and paragraphs. Similarly, titles, lists and tables are
         marked separately. The original files recieved from text producers are
         preserved as such and the conversion process is always started from the
         original file. The bibles however, have a special structure with books,
         chapters and verses; this structure is implemented very differently
         depending mostly on the type of the source file. For example, <a href="http://confluence.ubs-icap.org/display/USFM/Home">paratext</a> is
         a rich description language designed for bibles but in text- or word
         documents, less information of the structure of the bible text is
         available. 
      </p>
      <p>One goal of the processint of the bible text is to preserve or
         restore the original structure of the text. The bible texts can be
         better compared, the text can be searched using verse and chapter number
         and the structural information can be used in text alignment.
      </p>
      <h2 id="xml">XML-format of the bible</h2>
      <p>The XML format of the analyzed text is basically the following:</p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve"> &lt;book title="Fyrste Mosebok"&gt;
    &lt;chapter number="1"&gt;
      &lt;section title="Gud skaper verda"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;verse number="1"&gt; I opphavet skapte Gud himmelen og jorda.   &lt;/verse&gt;
          &lt;verse number="2"&gt; Jorda var aud og tom, og mørker låg over havdjupet. 
                             Men Guds Ande sveiv over vat net. &lt;/verse&gt;
          ...
        &lt;/p&gt;
        ...
     &lt;/section&gt;
   ...
   &lt;/chapter&gt;</pre>
      <p>See the description of the dtd for the exact format. This format is
         achieved by simplifying the original structure in some cases. For
         example, in many bible versions, the verse is printed without the
         number and taken out from the paragraph. Some versions may not have
         subtitles, so the section layer may be missing. The paragraph-marks
         are not added when they are not explicitely marked in the
         document.
      </p>
      <h2>The available files</h2>
      <p>The xml-formatted bible text is stored at <code>corp/orig/lang/nt
            </code>and <code>ot </code>-directories. The files are marked with
         suffix <code>.bible.xml.</code></p>
      <p>Most of the bible texts are under standard license conditions,
         which are explained in... At the moment, the corpus hierarchy contains
         the following bible texts:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>sme and smj:
               </strong><br>New Testament
         </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>nno and nob :
               </strong><br>Genesisi and Psalms
         </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>swe:
               </strong><br>New Testament, Genesis and Psalms
         </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>fin:
               </strong><br>New and Old Testaments, 1938 edition
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>The tool for converting bibles to text:
         <code>bible2xml.pl</code></h2>
      <p>Usage:</p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">corpus-analyze.pl [OPTIONS] file.bible.xml</pre>
      <p>The structure of the bible text is converted to the project's
         internal format. The verse-markings are removed and the verses are
         combined to form longer paragraphs. A sentence many times spreads over
         more than one verse, so when the verses are combined, there sentece
         structure is preserved.
