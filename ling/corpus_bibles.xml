      <p>The bibles are an important source of text in a language. It is even
      more imprtant source of parallel text, since the bible translations
      generally preserve the format of the text irrespectible of the target
      language. In this project, we have recieved bible texts for North and
      Lule Sámi, Bokmål, Nynorsk, Swedish and Finnish. Since the bibles have a
      specific format which requires separate processing than the other files,
      there is a documentation included.</p>

      <title id="database">Bible as a text source</title>

      <p>In general..</p>

      <p>The bible files are part of the general conversion process, which is
      described in the documents<a
      href="corpus_conversion.html">corpus_conversion.html</a> and <a
      href="corpus_conversion_tech.html">corpus_conversion_tech.html. </a>This
      conversion process is aimed to produce texts that are ready for
      linguistic analysis and research. The texts contain some structure, such
      as the sections and paragraphs. Similarly, titles, lists and tables are
      marked separately. The original files recieved from text producers are
      preserved as such and the conversion process is always started from the
      original file. The bibles however, have a special structure with books,
      chapters and verses; this structure is implemented very differently
      depending mostly on the type of the source file. For example, <a
      href="http://confluence.ubs-icap.org/display/USFM/Home">paratext</a> is
      a rich description language designed for bibles but in text- or word
      documents, less information of the structure of the bible text is
      available. </p>

      <p>One goal of the processint of the bible text is to preserve or
      restore the original structure of the text. The bible texts can be
      better compared, the text can be searched using verse and chapter number
      and the structural information can be used in text alignment.</p>

      <section>
        <title id="xml">XML-format of the bible</title>

        <p>The XML format of the analyzed text is basically the following:</p>

        <source> &lt;book title="Fyrste Mosebok"&gt;
    &lt;chapter number="1"&gt;
      &lt;section title="Gud skaper verda"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;verse number="1"&gt; I opphavet skapte Gud himmelen og jorda.   &lt;/verse&gt;
          &lt;verse number="2"&gt; Jorda var aud og tom, og mørker låg over havdjupet. 
                             Men Guds Ande sveiv over vat net. &lt;/verse&gt;
          ...
        &lt;/p&gt;
        ...
     &lt;/section&gt;
   ...
   &lt;/chapter&gt;</source>

        <p>See the description of the dtd for the exact format. This format is
        achieved by simplifying the original structure in some cases. For
        example, in many bible versions, the verse is printed without the
        number and taken out from the paragraph. Some versions may not have
        subtitles, so the section layer may be missing. The paragraph-marks
        are not added when they are not explicitely marked in the
        document.</p>

      <section>
        <title>The available files</title>

        <p>The xml-formatted bible text is stored at <code>corp/orig/lang/nt
        </code>and <code>ot </code>-directories. The files are marked with
        suffix <code>.bible.xml.</code></p>

        <p>Most of the bible texts are under standard license conditions,
        which are explained in... At the moment, the corpus hierarchy contains
        the following bible texts:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>sme and smj</dt>

          <dd>New Testament</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>nno and nob </dt>

          <dd>Genesisi and Psalms</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>swe</dt>

          <dd>New Testament, Genesis and Psalms</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>fin</dt>

          <dd>New and Old Testaments, 1938 edition</dd>
        </dl>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>The tool for converting bibles to text:
        <code>bible2xml.pl</code></title>

        <p>Usage:</p>

        <source>corpus-analyze.pl [OPTIONS] file.bible.xml</source>

        <p>The structure of the bible text is converted to the project's
        internal format. The verse-markings are removed and the verses are
        combined to form longer paragraphs. A sentence many times spreads over
        more than one verse, so when the verses are combined, there sentece
        structure is preserved.</p>
