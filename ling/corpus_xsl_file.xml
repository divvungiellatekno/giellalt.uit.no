            <title>XSL-files</title>

            <p>
                The purpose of the xsl files is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Add metadata about the original file. Examples of this is info
                    about the author, publishing year, which language it has been
                    translated from, who added the file to the repository, pointers
                    to parallel files, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add info about which parts of a document to exclude or include.
                    This especially handy for pdf documents, which is a fickly file
                    format to convert to xml. There is also support to do the same
                    for clean text, html and epub files.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add processing instructions, such as the languages
                    to which the text is categorized or some information of the text
                    layout.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The xsl-file is created when a file is added to a
                <a href="corpus_repositories.html">corpus repository</a>
                using
                <a href="http://divvun.no/doc/ling/CorpusTools.html#add_files_to_corpus">add_files_to_corpus</a>.
                The xsl-file is stored to the same directory as the original
                document, with the same name as the original document, and suffix <code>.xsl</code>.
            </p>

            <p>The variables are defined by expressions as the following:</p>

            <source>
&lt;xsl:variable name="title" select="''"/&gt;
&lt;xsl:variable name="author" select="''"/&gt;
&lt;xsl:variable name="author-gender" select="'f'"/&gt;
&lt;xsl:variable name="publisher" select="''"/&gt;
&lt;xsl:variable name="translated-from" select="''"/&gt;

&lt;xsl:variable name="mainlang" select="'sme'"/&gt;
            </source>

            <p>The information is updated by adding the new value to the
            "select"-field, inside single quotes. Most of the fields, such as
            the title and the name of the author can contain free text, but the
            values of some fields are restricted.</p>

            <p>
