      <title>Morphological disambiguation</title>

      <p>The project uses Eckhard Bick and Tino Dideriksens <strong>vislcg3</strong>, a compiler for
      constraint grammar, a formalism originally developed by a.o. Fred Karlsson and Pasi
      Tapanainen at the University of Helsinki.</p>

        files</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>So far, we have a disambiguation file
      <code>sme-dis.rle</code>, for North Sámi, and a file
      <code>smj-dis.rle</code> for Lule Sámi. In addition to that, we
      are working on beta versions for Greenlandic and Faroese. The
      content of the North Saami file is documented <a
      href="/lang/sme/docu-sme-dis.html">here</a>. </p>

        <title>Other versions of constraint grammar</title>

        <p>The philosophy behind constraint grammar is relatively simple, and
        the programming algorithms are found in several different version
        (the version we use at giellatekno is no. 5 on this list).</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The original CG formalism was developed by Fred Karlsson, at <a
          href="http://www.ling.helsinki.fi">Dept. of Linguistics in
          Helsinki</a></li>

          <li>Bart Jongejan's C++ version of the original CG</li>

          <li>A new version of CG, called CG-2, was developed by Pasi
          Tapanainen, cf. Tapanainen 1996. It is maintained by <a
          href="http://www.connexor.com">Connexor</a></li>

          <li>vislcg, an open source implementation of CG-2, at <a
          href="http://visl.hum.sdu.dk/visl/">http://visl.hum.sdu.dk/visl/</a>. This
          parser is available for download ad sourceforge, <a
          href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vislcg/">here</a>.</li>

          <li>vislcg3, a new generation version ov the open source
          vislcg is currently being developed at <a
          href="http://visl.hum.sdu.dk/visl/">http://visl.hum.sdu.dk/visl/</a>.</li>

            href="http://www.ling.helsinki.fi">Dept. of Linguistics in
            Helsinki</a></li>

            <li>LFG and HPSG-based tools ??</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For various reasons, do not use these tools, but have chosen
          constraint grammar instead.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Statistically-based disambiguation tools</title>

          <p>This is the dominating approach to disambiguation. Here, we think
          the grammar-based approach is on the right track, and we thus do not
          use statistically-based tools. In the future it still may be
          relevant to have a look at what statixtically-based tools may
          achieve when applied on the top of grammar-based disambiguation
          tools, in order to resolve on statistical grounds such open cases
          that cannot be dealt with by grammatical tools alone.</p>

          <p>Thus, we should at some point start orientating ourself in the
          world of statistically-based disambiguation tools.</p>
