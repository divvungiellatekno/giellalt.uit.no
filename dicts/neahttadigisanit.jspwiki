!!Content

A grammatical, reading dictionary which combines lexica in main/words/ with
analyzers to break down compounds, and provide meanings when compound
definitions do not exist, and more extensive corpus coverage.

!!Maintenance

!Updating dictionaries

... Then you must restart the service to reparse the XML trees, otherwise
old versions stored in memory will be used.

!Updating FSTs

Follow the paths in app.config.yaml to make check where the FSTs are installed,
and then copy the new versions to those paths. Note whether any 'special' dictionary
FSTs are in use and ensure that these are compiled and put in the new paths.

!Configuration file

app.config.yaml contains the following things, and is in
[YAML|http://www.yaml.org/refcard.html] format:

 * FST path and format definitions
 * XML dictionary path and format definitions
 * Language name defininitions and localisations
 * Base form information: for each part of speech for each language, words
   that have an analysis matching these tags will be looked up in the lexicon
   and shown to users.
 * Paradigm generation: these are for the word detail views only, and these forms
   will be generated and presented to users.
 * Tag rewrites: Tags in FSTs or Lexicon files will be rewritten before being presented
   to users. 

!Restarting the service

On gtoahpa, there are definitions in /etc/init.d that allow you to restart, and
start the service via the following commands:

{{{

    sudo service neahttadigisanit restart
    sudo /etc/init.d/neahttadigisanit restart

}}}

The service must be restarted each time lexica, FSTs, or the configuration file
have been updated. Sometimes this may take a little while, as XML files need to
be reparsed, and data structures for autocomplete need to be prepared.
