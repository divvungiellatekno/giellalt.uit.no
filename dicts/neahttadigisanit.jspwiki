__Neahttadigisánit__ is an online reading dictionary which uses analysers to
find lemma forms, and send them to dictionary lookup. This page documents
developmental work on Neahttadigisánit.

!! Using the NDS JavaScript Plugin on other sites.

__Neahttadigisánit__ provides an [in-browser plugin|http://sanit.oahpa.no/read/] 
that allows you to look up words by clicking on them. It is available by
bookmarklet, a bookmark that you click while on any site to include the
functionality, but it is also simple to include on other sites. For an example,
visit [Kursa|http://kursa.oahpa.no/].

If you are a site owner and want to include the plugin on your website
(so that the dictionary is available to all visitors), follow the
how-to guide:

!Configuration file

The file {{app.config.yaml}} contains the following things, and is in
[YAML|http://www.yaml.org/refcard.html] format:

 * FST path and format definitions
 * XML dictionary path and format definitions
 * Language name defininitions and localisations
 * Base form information: for each part of speech for each language, words
   that have an analysis matching these tags will be looked up in the lexicon
   and shown to users.
 * Paradigm generation: these are for the word detail views only, and these forms
   will be generated and presented to users.
 * Tag rewrites: Tags in FSTs or Lexicon files will be rewritten before being presented
   to users.

!Restarting the service


This documentation may be obsolete. See the ''Dont panic'' link for
updated info on restart.

(__TODO:__ ''Delete obsolete documentation'')

On gtoahpa, there are definitions in /etc/init.d that allow you to restart, and
start the service via the following commands:

{{{

    sudo service neahttadigisanit restart
    sudo /etc/init.d/neahttadigisanit restart

}}}

This is a shortcut which restarts the process defined in neahttadigisanit.fcgi,
so if any issues crop up, that is the place to start debugging. Alternatively,
run the development server to check for errors with `python neahtta.py`.

The service must be restarted each time lexica, FSTs, or the configuration file
have been updated. Sometimes this may take a little while, as XML files need to
be reparsed, and data structures for autocomplete need to be prepared.
