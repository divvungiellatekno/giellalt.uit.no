We use the Macintosh Dictionary for Mac OS 10.5 and newer, and [StarDict](http://stardict.com) for other platforms.

Documentation still not written. While waiting, here are the principles:

So far, we have compiled dictionaries for North and South Sami, and for Kven (but Kven without morphology).

The dictionary content is based upon the dictionary files in our
words/dicts/smenob/src/ catalogues (see the source files, and replace
"smenob" with the language pair of your choice).

For each lemma, we generate the corresponding workforms.
The makefile for generating the dictionary paradigms is found in $LANG/testing/.
Each wordform is then linked via its lemma to the dictionary explanation.

The result is like documented for *Vuosttáš digisánit*.
