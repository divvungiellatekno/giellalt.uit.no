﻿# Troubleshooting frequent problems

This document goes through some frequent problems.

##  500 error: Invalid tagset <pos>. Choose one of: 


This means the tagset file is missing, or `pos` is not a valid category in that file.


To fix:


1. Go to: .../configs/language_specific_rules/tagsets
1. Check that ZZZ.tagset exists, where ZZZ is the language ISO (this may be `udm`,
1.  `udmM`, or some other short code used within NDS for the language).
1. Then, 
	- If it exists: edit the file and add a `pos` category with at least one entry
	- If it does not exist: create the file, and do the above.


For more information on tagsets, see [NDS Linguistic settings](NDSLinguisticSettings.html).


##  automake problems


```
    WARNING: 'aclocal-1.13' is missing on your system.
             You should only need it if you modified 'acinclude.m4' or
             'configure.ac' or m4 files included by 'configure.ac'.
             The 'aclocal' program is part of the GNU Automake package:
```


This usually means there's a problem with the path variable, on gtdict, the correct versions of automake should be installed. Observe the
output of *which automake*, and check that it leads to the proper version.

 


##  HTML appears in templates


Try switching internationalization languages and see if the problem remains: if
it does not, then the problem is likely somewhere in a .po file, which means
that somewhere there is a string containing HTML that is not properly escaped.
This can be tricky to debug, but will usually arise by looking at Git diffs,
and comparing to working versions.


##  Audio links do not work (opens new tab)


This is a newer feature and hasn't been tested on many projects, however the
easiest thing to check here:


1. go to language_specific_rules/templates/PROJNAME/
1. look for `includes.template`. If this file isn't there, create it, based on what exists in `itwewina/includes.template`. Copy the two JS include lines for SoundManager and audio_links.js




##  gtdict language compile process errors


Occasionally an installation problem will arise due to source updates or
updates within `giella-core`. Occasionally the problems can be fixed by using
*make distclean*, before recompiling the language, or by updating *giella-core*,
and then compiling.  Sometimes this will not work.


Since these problems arise in a deployment situation, it is usually best to
delete the language catalog and check it out again. 


##  String compilation failed, aborting:  babel.core.UnknownLocaleError: unknown locale 'hdn' 


There are two possible problems: 


 * Compile with a more specific version of this command, i.e., `fab PROJNAME compile`
 * A locale is not installed in the project environment


In the case of the second, see the section *Dat files* in [NDS Localisations](NDSLocalisations.html).


## fab is unable to copy FSTs


```
    cp: cannot create regular file ‘/opt/smi/vep/bin/analyser-dict-gt-desc.xfst’: Permission denied
    cp: cannot create regular file ‘/opt/smi/vep/bin/generator-dict-gt-norm.xfst’: Permission denied
```


Cause: File permissions and owners on certain files have been overridden.


Fix:
* Run the following:
```
    	chown neahtta:neahtta /opt/smi/ISO/bin/*
``` 


Cause: The FSTs have not actually compiled. 


Fix:
* Check that running `make` in the language directory in `$GTLANGS` actually works as expected.




##  500: "unsupported format character "n" (0x6e) at index 20"


Cause: one of the python formatted variables in the translation strings has the
wrong syntax. This is not surprising, because variable formatting in python
strings has an annoying syntax:


```
    %(variable_name)s
```


Where both the % and the s are required parts of syntax. This is confusing,
because `s` will look surprisingly like the human languages contained in the
strings.


Fix:


* First: confirm that the server is running the most up-to-date versions of the
  localization files by updating from Git and compiling the strings,
  `fab PROJECT compile-strings` and restarting the service


* If there is still a problem, then likely one of the translation strings is
  misformatted. For the affected locale, search through the `.po` file for 
  the affected template, and doublecheck that all translations marked with 
  `#, python-format` have variables with the correct syntax. 


    OR:


  Do a regular expression search for everything not in the correct format. In
  vim, I use the following expression: you may have to rewrite this to the
  correct regexp format for your own editor.


```


  %\((.*)\)[^s\w\s]


```


## Compounding problems

Make sure the tagstring is the correct one, the fst is correct, and the tags are declared.
