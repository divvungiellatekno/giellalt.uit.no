Meeting on NDS documentation 20.9.16


Ciprian, Ryan, Trond


Issues
* fab fine -- far too much?
* What to update in the source code
* There are modules with plans, TODOs
* We need a technical documentation, **top-down style**
** We need a float scheme, a box diagram:
** Here are the components, here is how they work together
** Here are their raison d'Ãªtre


Cases in point, examples:
* docker ([https://www.docker.com]) Why is it there?
* Another case: How to include a language without morphology
* Log the IP address
* The flax documentation -- you have an xml database -- why?
* The link between the documentation and the code


Scenarios:
* When you want to update the code
* When you want to see the code functionality


Debugging
* How do you develop the code?
* How do you debug?
** Is there a developer mode for debugging?
** IDE?
* logging 
* svn root checkout results in permissions problems


The FAB documentation: 
* To compile whatever remotely... ("this works only with hfst")
** so, why?


Functions:
* There are many functions, most are not in use?
* Speed:
** Ms time logging from pressing ENTER to getting the answer 
   (with intermediate timepoints, in order to see the time leak)


# Top-down


We actually need two top-down


# static
## this is the system, top-down
# dynamic   
## this is the (process, lookup) as the lemma lookup goes along
## Conceptually, the dynamics is clear, but it must be **linked** to
   the concrete files


# Comments


The *docker* was there because Ryan needed it for experimenting on another 
place than the production environment. It is not needed for production.


**TODO:** Put explanation in 
[the readme file](https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/apps/dicts/nds/src/README.md) .


# Flask


Flask is the django of NDS. The xml database = **the dictionary**.
Oahpa uses a relational database, but flask uses xml for the dictionary.


# Adding dictionaries


It was not clear what was required and what was not.


We need a separate documentation for NDS without morphology 
(Trond note: Even half an hour work will give a useful fst).


Feature: Export to paper-readable format


# User behaviour


* sudo su neahtta \\ 
  (there might a problem with several neahtta users at the same time,
  the answer message being "profile closed" or something)
* ssh neahtta@gtweb.uit.no


# Advanced features


##  nobsme hverandre


What it does is great, how it is done is hmm not. needs documentation


##  Reference to (sic.) references


Adding new lexicon attributes to the xml template:


# add to xml and dtd ok (but NDS does not read the dtd, only the xml)
# What matters is the jinja xml template,  cf. (jinja use is documented for paradigms, but not for HTML templates for entries)
  [/dicts/nds/NDSLinguisticSettings.html]


# Development


[/dicts/nds/NDSDeveloping.html]


Using **virtualenv** for building a development session


"you may start work on NDS"


means:


Now we set up an environment so that you may run python here, and
**run NDS** here.


```
(env) tf-hsl-m0016:neahtta ttr000$     fab itwewina runserver
[localhost] Executing task 'itwewina'


Warning: Unable to load SSH config file '/Users/ttr000/.ssh/config'


[localhost] Executing task 'runserver'


Warning: Unable to load SSH config file '/Users/ttr000/.ssh/config'


** Production config not found, using development (*.in)
** Go.
[localhost] local: NDS_CONFIG=configs/itwewina.config.yaml.in python neahtta.py dev
* Missing dependency in $PATH: uglifyjs
  Install the executable, check that it is available in $PATH, 
  and check that it's executable. 


Done.
(env) tf-hsl-m0016:neahtta ttr000$ pwd
