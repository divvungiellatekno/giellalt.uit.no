This document explains how to start new Neahttadigisánit projects.

#  Starting a new project

Commands here may assume that you have already configured the virtual
environment. If you are not sure, you probably have not done so. See
[Developing in NDS and virtualenv](NDSDeveloping.html).

Also this assumes you have determined a project short name already. These can
be changed at a later time, but with some amount of find/replace work, and
moving directories. Below, PROJNAME will stand in for this. Replace it with
your project name.

##  Create the configuration file

1. In the terminal, move to `$GTHOME/apps/dicts/nds/neahtta/`
1. Copy `configs/sample.config.yaml.in` to `configs/PROJNAME.yaml.in`
1. Add the new file to SVN.
1. Open the file in a text editor, and read through the settings. There are
  numerous comments to guide you.
1. When you are done, check in the changes.

##  Adding language names

1. Open the file `configs/language_names.yaml`
1. For each language in the project, check the following (there are plenty of comments to guide you):
    1. the `NAMES` variable contains the ISO codes, and then a string marked for
   localization with the language names in English
    1. the `LOCALISATION_NAMES_BY_LANGUAGE` contains ISO codes, and the language's
   own name / endonym
    1. the `ISO_TRANSFORMS` contains any potential pairs of two-character and
   three-character ISO codes

##  Create additional directories and files

TODO:

##  Fabfile

1. Search the file for instances of *sample* and follow the instructions there.
1. DO NOT check this in yet.

##  Makefile

1. copy sample to a new location, uncomment it, and follow the instructions there.
1. Be sure to replace instances of *sample* in your new section with the PROJNAME.

**TODO:** this is a slightly more complex part, which I wish to do away with by
generalizing the makefile settings into the .yaml.in config, interpreted by
'fabric'. Make will still be used, but everything will be configured by
environment variables instead. This way we can ensure that configuration is an
easier process, and build information is more visible.

##  Test the configuration

1. In the terminal, move to `$GTHOME/apps/dicts/nds/neahtta/`
1. Activate the virtualenv
1. Run `fab PROJNAME compile`, and wait until the process completes.
1. Run `fab PROJNAME test_configuration`, and wait until the process
  completes. Check FST path names and ensure that the build process moved all
  the files to the proper location.
1. Run `fab PROJNAME runserver`. If this completes, navigate to the
  address that you see at the end of the output in your browser.
1. Does everything seem to work as intended? If so...

##  Check in the configurations

Check in the following config files

1. fabfile.py
1. dicts/Makefile
1. config/language_names.py
1. config/PROJNAME.config.yaml.in

##  Create additional files

TODO: confirm that there isn't anything required for the base configuration to
work (maybe user friendly tag file?)

#  Server-side configuration

##  Adding opt directories for FST deployment

If, while editing the Makefile, you are creating new languages in the *opt*
directory for deployment, there are three things to do:

1. create */opt/smi/LANG/bin*
1. check permissions on directories */opt/smi/LANG/bin* and */opt/smi/LANG*, if it is owned by the group *neahtta*, and writeable by that group

##  Configuring nginx

TODO:

##  Installing an init.d script

TODO:

#  Added polish

Now that we have a running instance, it's time for some extra configuration.

##  Flags

For languages that have a translation available in the interface, a flag is
necessary for the menu. Wikipedia provides pretty much all flags in SVG format,
and automatically converts to PNG. To get a roughly 20 x 15 px flag, use the
following steps:

* Find the flag `.svg` page in wikipedia, e.g. by browsing to the language
  page or region page, and click on the flag:
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Nenets_Autonomous_District.svg]
* Look for the link just below: "This image rendered as PNG in other sizes:
  200px, 500px, 1000px, 2000px."
* Click any size, preferrably the smallest, and alter the url path, to change
  the width of the flag to 20px:

```
    http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Flag_of_Nenets_Autonomous_District.svg/200px-Flag_of_Nenets_Autonomous_District.svg.png
    ->
    http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Flag_of_Nenets_Autonomous_District.svg/20px-Flag_of_Nenets_Autonomous_District.svg.png
```

Save the file to static/img/flags/, and match the path name so that it is
`LOCALE_20x15.png`.

##  Linguistic configuration (paradigms, etc.)

See [NDS Linguistic Settings](NDSLinguisticSettings.html).

#  Configuring a new pair in an existing instance

So far the process is a little complex, but there are things that can be
done mostly by linguists once the basic structure is in place. In each
following section, I'll mark who the role is best suited for, thus it's
clearer where work can be shared.

This following process assumes that there is already a service existing
to which a new language pair is being added.

##   1.) Establish a build process for the FSTs and lexicon.

**Intended**: Programmers

###  FST build process in dicts/Makefile

This is mainly meant as a convenience for easy developing.

Assuming that the language uses the *langs/* infrastructure, adding
another to a dictionary set's build process is easy. Find the targets
for the dictionary set, for example, *kyv* and *kyv-install*, and add
the language ISO to the variable *GT_COMPILE_LANGS* for these
targets.

```
    .PHONY: baakoeh-install
    baakoeh-install: GT_COMPILE_LANGS := sma nob
    baakoeh-install: install_langs_fsts

    .PHONY: baakoeh
    baakoeh: GT_COMPILE_LANGS := sma nob
    baakoeh: baakoeh-lexica compile_langs_fsts
    [... snip ...]
```

These targets will build analysers as usual, but the **-install* targets
are there as a convenience for when overwriting the analysers in
*/opt/smi/* is allowed. **Be careful** with this though, because with
language sets like *sánit* and *baakoeh* which are very much in
production mode now, there may be some unintended consequences.

In any case, the targets that these will write to are
dictionary-specific, and will not overwrite analysers for other
projects.

```
    /opt/smi/LANG/bin/dict-LANG.fst
    /opt/smi/LANG/bin/dict-iLANG-norm.fst
    /opt/smi/LANG/bin/some-LANG.fst
```

###  Troubleshooting

If you do not succeed in getting these make targets to work with a new
language, run the process manually. It might be that *make distclean*
needs to be run once within the language directory, and then things will
work.

###  Lexicon in the Makefile

Editing the Makefile is a little tricky. You will need to add a target
for the lexicon file or files.

Lexica are compiled using a *Saxon* process, and the Makefile contains
some variables that can be used as shortcuts. For languages using
*langs/* infrastructure for the lexicon, the best option is the
following:

```
    ZZZ-all.xml: $(GTHOME)/langs/ZZZ/src/morphology/stems/*.xml
	    @echo "**************************"
	    @echo "** Building ZZZ lexicon **"
	    @echo "**************************"
	    @echo "** Backup made (.bak)   **"
	    @echo "**************************"
	    @echo ""
	    -@cp $@ $@.$(shell date +%s).bak
	    mkdir ZZZ
	    cp $^ ZZZ/
	    $(SAXON) inDir=$(pwd)/ZZZ/ > ZZZ-all.xml
	    rm -rf ZZZ/
```

The above makes a copy of the XML files, and then uses the Saxon process
to compile them all into one file, with no additional processing.

This process will be the same if the lexica are in `main/words/dicts/`,
however some languages there have multiple subdirectories that need to
be copied before the Saxon process is run.

Make note of the filename that you intend to output this to, and add it
to the language installation’s lexicon target, for example, **kyv-lexica**,
**muter-lexica**, and also the remove target
(such as **rm-kyv-lexica** etc.).

##  2.) Edit the .yaml file for new FSTs and Dictionaries

**Intended**: Programmers, linguists

Realistically anyone can do this as long as the build process is
working, since most of this should be a cut-and-paste job.

Once you're done, save the file and attempt to restart the service.

If everything seems to be working, do not check in the config file
itself, but copy the values to *INSTANCE.config.yaml.in*, and check that
in. This is simply so that no incoming updates to config files will
destroy existing production configs.

###  *Morphology*  section

This needs to have the paths to the new analysers, for each language
ISO. Follow one of the existing languages and adjust the values as
necessary. If any language variants (mobile spellrelax) need to be
included, a good idea is to use the language ISO as the key, but with
one letter appended, i.e., *udm* for mobile would be *udmM*.

In any case, the morphology section should contain a new entry like the
following:

```
    YYY:
      tool: *LOOKUP
      file: [*OPT, '/YYY/bin/dict-YYY.fst']
      inverse_file: [*OPT, '/YYY/bin/dict-iYYY-norm.fst']
      format: 'xfst'
      options:
        compoundBoundary: "+Use/Circ#"
        derivationMarker: "+Der"
        tagsep: '+'
        inverse_tagsep: '+'
```

Where `YYY` is the language ISO path. Note the weird way that forming
paths with aliases is handled here in YAML, they may be strings or
lists, and if they are lists, they will be automatically concatinated
into strings. This must be done because YAML does not allow string
concatenation with aliases/variables.

###  *Languages*  section

Add a new entry for the language iso to this list.

###  *Dictionaries*  section

Here, add a new item to the list of dictionaries, relative to the
`neahtta` path, i.e., `dicts/file-name.xml`.

```
    Dictionaries:

      # [... snip ...]

      - source: udm
        target: hun
        path: 'dicts/udm-all.xml'
```

For more information on all the settings for this chunk, see the page on YAML
configuration:
[The Neahttadigisánit Configuration](FilesForConfiguratingNDS.html)

##  3.) Define language names and translation strings

**Intended**: Linguists

Open the file *configs/language_names.py*. Here you will need to add the
language ISO to several variables. Save when done, and be sure to check
in in SVN.

###  NAMES

Here we define the name in English, so that it will be available for
translation to any interface languages.

```
    ('sme', _(u"North Sámi")),
```

The most easy way is to copy one existing line, and replace the contents
of the strings. If you're unfamiliar with Python, be careful not to
remove any underscores around the strings, and only edit the contents.

The first value should be the language ISO, **or** the language variant
(*SoMe*, *udmM*, *kpvS*, etc.)

###  LOCALISATION_NAMES_BY_LANGUAGE

Here we have the ISO and the language's name in the language.

```
    ('sme', u"Davvisámegiella"),
```

Again, copy and paste a line, and only edit the strings.

###  ISO_TRANSFORMS

If the language has a two-character ISO as well as a three-character
ISO, we must have these defined here.

```
    ('se', 'sme'),
    ('no', 'nob'),
    ('fi', 'fin'),
    ('en', 'eng'),
```

##  4.) Define tagsets, and paradigms, user-friendly tag relabels

**Intended**: Linguists

If you wish to have paradigms visible in the language, you will need two
things:

 * *Tagsets* files: [NDS Linguistic Settings](NDSLinguisticSettings.html)
 * *.paradigm* files:  [NDS Linguistic Settings](NDSLinguisticSettings.html)
 * *.context* files:  [NDS Linguistic Settings](NDSLinguisticSettings.html)
 * *.relabel* files: [NDS Linguistic Settings](NDSLinguisticSettings.html)

The easiest means of course is to look at existing languages and copy
what they do.

When done with these steps, be sure to add the new files and directories
to svn and check them in.

#  Server config

Things to consider:

 * nginx configuration file
 * init.d script: make sure to pick an unused port, change the config file, and
   also the path to the pid file, otherwise bad things happen

# Linguistic requirements

**Intended**: Linguists

* The xml format of the lexicon should match sme-nob or sma-nob format as
  closely as possible (`words/dicts/smanob/src`)
* morphological analysers (FSTs, described below)
* lists of tag pairs, what is in FST to convert to what users will see
* lists of paradigms for parts of speech
    - they can be either as detailed as one paradigm per part of speech, or several
   paradigms for parts of speech and varying sub-types. These will have to be
   marked in the lexicon in some way, for exampl, plural-only proper noun
   paradigms for North Saami
* description of attributes in the XML that need to be displayed to the user

#  Collecting the materials...

##  FSTs

###  Lookup FST

Lookup FST tags may be in any format, as these can be relabeled for users at a
later stage.

```
    vuovdi
    vuovdi  vuovdit+V+TV+PrsPrc
    vuovdi  vuovdit+V+TV+Imprt+Du2
    vuovdi  vuovdit+V+TV+Der/NomAg+N+Sg+Nom
    vuovdi  vuovdit+V+TV+Der/NomAg+N+Sg+Gen
    vuovdi  vuovdit+V+TV+Der/NomAg+N+Sg+Acc
    vuovdi  vuovdi+Sem/Plc+N+Sg+Nom
    vuovdi  vuovdi+A+Sg+Nom
    vuovdi  vuovdi+A+Sg+Gen
    vuovdi  vuovdi+A+Sg+Acc
    vuovdi  vuovdi+Sem/Hum+N+NomAg+Sg+Nom
    vuovdi  vuovdi+Sem/Hum+N+NomAg+Sg+Gen
    vuovdi  vuovdi+Sem/Hum+N+NomAg+Sg+Acc
```

It is best to use the analysers compiled with
*--enable-dicts*, because this will strip extraneous tags.

### Spell relax FST

Spell relaxing FSTs should follow the exact same format as the lookup FST, but
naturally point to the normative lemmas, or whatever lemmas will be used in
lookups in the lexicon. These could be of three types:

1. Normalizing non-standard spellings
1. Compensating for keyboards without certain characters
1. Switching orthographies, e.g., accepting latin for cyrillic, or vice versa.

Whatever the use case, the analyzed lemma must match up with the lexicon
entry.

Spellrelax behaviour is governed in `$GTHOME/langs/$LANG/src/orhtography`.
Here, there are two scripts: *spellrelax.regex* and
*spellrelax-mobile-keyboard.regex*. These will result in two analysers,
the first containing the spellrelax.regex rules, and the latter will
contain the rules for both regex files. The latter is intended for the
SoMe option (see e.g. [sanit.oahpa.no](http://sanit.oahpa.no)).

* analyser-dict-gt-desc.xfst
* analyser-dict-gt-desc-mobile.xfst

Put variation **within** the norm, and variation invisible to the user,
in the former file, and ad hoc / dirty hack variation in the latter.

###  Compound marking

Must have a defined (and consistent) method for marking compounds:

```
    vuovdedoaibma
    vuovdedoaibma   vuovdi subst.  + #doaibma subst. ent. nom.
    vuovdedoaibma   vuovdi adj.  + #doaibma subst. ent. nom.
    vuovdedoaibma   vuovdedoaibma subst. ent. nom.
```

**Compound marker**: ``` "  + #" ```

This setting can be configured in the YAML settings file.

###  Derivation marking

Must also be able to specify how all derivational suffixes are marked, because
this affects how lexicalized words are displayed when a derivation has a
lexicalized form.

```
    oahpásmahttit
    oahpásmahttit   oahpásmuvvat verb avl.suff.-ahtti verb inf.
    oahpásmahttit   oahpásmuvvat verb avl.suff.-ahtti verb imp. 2.p.flt.
    oahpásmahttit   oahpásmuvvat verb avl.suff.-ahtti verb ind. pres. 1.p.flt.
    oahpásmahttit   oahpásmuvvat verb avl.suff.-ahtti verb nom.Ag. subst. fl. nom.
```

**Derivation marker**: ``` "suff." ```

This setting can be configured in the YAML settings file.

###  Generation FST

For generation, currently sme and sma use the typical tag format for GT, but,
we have a special generator FST that removes non-standard forms. Also, sma has
some special entries that are marked with a hid attribute
(göövledh+1, göövledh+2) were generation depends on
meaning. These must be included in the generation FST.

##  Lexicon

It may be that the analysis FST does not match absolutely with the lexicon, and
this is okay. But, if this is so, it is important to know where the differences
are.

For instance, the above examples show "noun" and "verb" as
the part of speech in the analyzer, but the lexicon only knows "N"
and "V". Thus, in order to line up these tools, the programmers will
need to have a list of all of these things to formulate rules.
