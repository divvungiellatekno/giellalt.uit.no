!!! Including Neahttadigis√°nit in a website

At minimum, two or three files need to be included on any page of content that
you wish to include NDS with. If you are using a Content Management System, you
may need to edit the system's templates in the relevant location to include
these files.

* {{neahttadigisanit.css}} - the stylesheet that provides styling for the
  definition bubbles and options menu
* {{neahttadigisanit.jquery.min.js}} - the main Neahttadigisanit (compressed) JS
  file, with its own version of jQuery
* Optionally, you may include a third file that contains the options and
  actually initializes the plugin, or simply put this in a {{<script />}} node

NB: if you prefer to use a version of jQuery that is already in use on your
website, there is a version of the NDS source compiled without it:
{{neahttadigisanit.min.js}}.

!! Including the files

You can either download and rehost these files, or use our copies directly.
Either way is alright, but your site will still need to permit users' browsers
to make external API calls. All API calls use JSONP, so cross-domain API calls
should be permitted.

There are a few strategies for including these: first, the stylesheet must be
in the header. It should hopefully not interfere with any local styles, as all
the selectors refer only to things that involve NDS. If this turns out not to
be the case, report a bug.

{{{
    <link rel="stylesheet" 
          href="http://sanit.oahpa.no/static/css/neahttadigisanit.css"></link>

    <script type="text/javascript" 
            src="http://sanit.oahpa.no/static/js/neahttadigisanit.jquery.min.js"></script>
}}}

Second: the JS file may be included in the header, or toward the footer so that
it does not delay other content in the site from loading.

!! Initializing the plugin

The final step is to call the plugin. Typically, you will want to do this
within a jQuery event-- usually when the document is ready. This code may be
included in its own {{script}} node, but must run after the {{.js}} file has been
included.

{{{
    // Wait for the document to load...
    $(document).ready(function (){

        // Initialize and configure NDS
        $(document).selectToLookup({
            // This specifies the dictionary set to 
            api_host: 'http://sanit.oahpa.no/',
        });
    });
}}}

For most purposes you should be able to just copy and paste this JS snippet
without changes. If you need another dictionary set, you may alter the
{{api_host}} setting:

* South Saami / Norwegian - http://baakoeh.oahpa.no/
* More coming soon...

Mind the trailing slash.
