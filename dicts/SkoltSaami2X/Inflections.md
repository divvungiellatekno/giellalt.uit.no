This page is part of the documentation of the [Skolt Saami dictionary projects at Giellatekno](../SkoltSaami2X.html).




Inflected forms are listed as lemmas of its own (with translations) if they occur in teaching materials or other sources and need to be compiled for oahpa and other dictionaries where users might search for them. For saan.oahpa.org these data is not used (because the FST should find inflected forms).




# The file inf_sms2X




# Open question


Is it useful to handle inflected forms like this?
