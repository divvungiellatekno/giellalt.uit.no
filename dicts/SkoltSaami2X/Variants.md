This page is part of the documentation of the [Skolt Saami dictionary projects at Giellatekno](../SkoltSaami2X.html).




Variants  (dialectal, etc.) are stored in a separate file with the link to the respective main lemma as a variable.




# The file var_sms2X




# Open question


Note that this is a weird structure, perhaps, but I want to park these variants somewhere. We do not need them now for Giellatekno-tools. However,Their final place cannot be in the main lemma list.
