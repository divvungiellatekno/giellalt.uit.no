We plan to use mainly North Saami L1 texts:

# Newspaper texts
# Fiction

At the moment, our newspaper corpus is appr. 10 mill words, and our fiction corpus is appr. 0.2 mill words.

We will need to improve both corpus conversion and grammatical analysis in order to include these texts in DeepDict. We will also discuss with text providers before including texts.
