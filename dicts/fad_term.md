## Revised deadlines 


(forthcoming)




# Project plan


This is for sme. We wait with sma, smj.


# Sentence align (**Ciprian, Børre**)
# Word align and make parallel wordlists (**Francis**)
# Check for relevant vocabulary (**BM**)
# Integrate the resulting list into Autshumato (**Ciprian, etc.**)


# Work ahead


# Correct the sentence alignment
# Rerun the parallel list


We need a new version of the parallel list, but with input from what we have:


* Use the improved sentence-aligned corpus
* Improve the tag usage for word alignment
** For both lgs: POS and derivation tags, valency tags:
** We need info on Pass for nob (**Francis**)
** We do not want tense-person-number for sme verbs
* Find threshold number (**BM**)
