# Plan for administrative terminology (forvaltningsordbok)

People working on the first phase of the project: *Børre, Ciprian, Francis, Trond*. The next phase will involve lexicographers.

# Background and project outline

Project 08431 from FAD for work on **Forvaltningsordboken**. The [Prosjektskisse](fad_bakgrunn.html) is the original project outline.

## Revised deadlines

(forthcoming)

# Project plan

This is for sme. We wait with sma, smj.

1. Sentence align (**Ciprian, Børre**)
1. Word align and make parallel wordlists (**Francis**)
1. Check for relevant vocabulary (**BM**)
1. Integrate the resulting list into Autshumato (**Ciprian, etc.**)

# Work ahead

1. Correct the sentence alignment
1. Rerun the parallel list

We need a new version of the parallel list, but with input from what we have:

* Use the improved sentence-aligned corpus
* Improve the tag usage for word alignment
    - For both lgs: POS and derivation tags, valency tags:
    - We need info on Pass for nob (**Francis**)
    - We do not want tense-person-number for sme verbs
* Find threshold number (**BM**)

# Status quo, progress (comments in here)

Old month reports are in the [background](fad_bakgrunn.html) document.
