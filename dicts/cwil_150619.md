#  Suggestions for NDS

##  FST issues
* imperatives not for all verbs (remove them from FST?)
* weather verbs never pl (remove them from FST, -> IICONJ-SG)
* rain : kimiwan - remove Loc from FST?
* Missing verb forms in FST (4-5)

##  Layout for paradigms
* 1./2. p section, and then 3. p section
* Ind - Cnj - Imp - Fut
* verb type visible
* VAI 3 - TI2, because of the form), two types II, and then impersonal and personal ones => recognise subclasses
* VIA instead of Verb

## Interface issues – click in text
* Icon for menu: á -> ā
* Menu:
    - option with morphological analysis
    - syllabics option
    - change metalanguage option

## Interface issues – web page
* icon for crk? discussion, no conclusion
* wild-card search, which will not be sent to the analyser
* autosuggest with timer?
* restrictions: some words should not be suggested in the the autofill
* hidden version, for developers, with the new features
* list all words option:
    - according to initial letter
    - reverse option
* syllabics fonts <sh> orientation, may be free ones that are correct
* to much empty space between the univ logos and the lookup
* possible to add audios
* right margin:
    - leave the typing visible for the user
    - add stem, eg. nipâw is a possible form of nipâ-
    - Search: sisipak -> "You ment sîsîpak, the Noun Animate Plural of sîsîp"

## Spell relax issues
* should recognize for long vowels: aa, A, a, click in box, macron, circumflex
* present the correct spelling to the right
* mâci-: should be spell-relax in the NDS interface because mâci- is not in the FST

## Ideas for an app
* app version with wordform lists?

## Notes

```
mâcinipâw -> ?
mâci-nipâw -> has result

ryan's machine:

macinipâw
macinipâw	PV/maci+nipâw+V+AI+Ind+Prs+3Sg
macinipâw	PV/maci+nipâw+V+AI

mâcinipâw
mâcinipâw	PV/maci+nipâw+V+AI+Ind+Prs+3Sg
mâcinipâw	PV/maci+nipâw+V+AI

but, this doesn't return a result in NDS
```
